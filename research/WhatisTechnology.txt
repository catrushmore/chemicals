Bigelow - technology understood to be the application of the sciences to the useful arts, or the practical application of owledge, especially in industry or commerce. 
He saw technology as objects but also activity: invention, design, production, maintenance, craft
also technical knowhow and skills, rules of thumb, even unconcious sensorimotor awareness

Kranzberg and Purcell - technology is the area of interaction between ourselves, as individuals, and our environment whether material, spiritual natural or manmade

Bigelow probably comes closest with the rules of thumb  and maintenance, to almost mentioning domestic knowledge.
