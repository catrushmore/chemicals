Focuses on the extraction and chemistry of salt, with some named uses but these tend not to include any discussion of the user. The only mention of users (in the period Iâ€™m looking at) is to wonder whether they know about the orgins of the salt they use. Other references to users consider the production of poor quality salt for culinary uses for poor people who apparently preferred it bitter and dirty. 

Potentially useful for another look later on as it discusses soda but again is more the production and some generic uses rather than looking at the choices people had between things. Brands not really mentioned, though possible reference to the borax production in US.
