Although the focus of this research is on British homes, it is relevant to know what is happening internationally with regards to greater understanding about chemicals. Environmental threats caused by the industrial use of chemicals eg mercury, may well have a bearing on both the availability of a product (for example if it has to be withdrawn or reformulated) and attitudes towards that chemical. 

Chloralkali plants had used mercury - were ordered to stop 1970. What did chloralkali plants need mercury for and what replaced it?

Main projects of late 1960s and 1970s was to reduce or eliminate mercury from industrial production. Even if inert mercury was released into the environment, bacteria could metabolise it into a lipid soluble form which would then accumulate in fish etc. 

Discovered that mercury could travel long distances by air, so it wasnâ€™t just the places that recieved contaminated waste water that were polluted. In new resevoirs where the methylmercury levels were higher than in other bodies of water it was later explained that bacteria would work on naturally occuring mercury in vegetation and that as the water rose in the resevoir, plants would be drowned and mercury methylated.
