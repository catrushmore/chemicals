Copper sulphatehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper(II)_sulfatehttp://www.occup-med.com/content/6/1/34 Copper sulphate is an easily accessible chemical in Sri Lanka that is sold over the counter. It is commonly used as a pesticide, in leather industry and also in making home-made glue. Burning of copper sulphate in houses and shops (as a good luck charm and for religious activities) is a common practice among Buddhists and Hindus. The marine blue colour of the hydrated form of copper sulphate crystals is attractive to children and is a reason for inadvertent poisoning. However, many admissions due to copper sulphate poisoning in adult medicine are acts of deliberate self harm.

When such fundamental cleaning cannot be done a carpet can be made to look clean and fresh, if, after the thorough double sweeping, it is lightly washed with warm water and ammonia. About three tablespoons of household ammonia in a pail of warm water is sufficient. Go over the carpet quickly and lightly, drying well as you go. Pay special attention to spots and grease marks, using a few drops of ammonia for them. Remove candle grease with a hot iron and blotting paper. // There are various powders, liquids and soaps sold now for cleaning carpets, usually very good, but they are expensive in the long run and ammonia is cheap and very cleansing. Sutton et al Early 1980s deposition of ATMOSPHERIC ammonia leads to soil acidification and eutrophicationNitrogen compounds in manures as well as artificial nitrogen compounds had been known since the mid 19th C as excellent fertilisers to improve p lant growth (which artificial compounds? Fixation of nitrogen on a commercial scale was driven by need for TNT/ explosives. Not until the 1950s that large scale consumption fo fixed N fo use as fertiliser began.

Ammonia – Brunner Mond Haber plant, construction started at the time of the Amistice signing. Possible construction of Cyanamid plant 1919. US was vulnerable to supplies of fixed N being cut off, as had to import much by boat. UK was self sufficient, exporting much of it. Factories fixing nitrogen for munitions (US) were shut down and did not produce fertilsers after the war. Argues that only using it for munitions is silly, disrepair, lack of expertise, won’t be able to quickly operate from disuse in times of need for munitions. “There can be no danger of excessive esupplies of fertiliser material. THer is iplenty of lant to put it on which has never received a puond of commercial fertiliser.”  Other uses beyond agriculture (e.g. domestic products containing ammonia) are not commented on. http://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com/materials-fertilizer-bombs-not-regulated Ammonium nitrate as bought from the garden centre (at least now) needs to be refined before it can be used in an explosive, but this process is not complicated and is well documented. Alum shales – Whitby.
