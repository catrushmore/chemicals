Dubos, Rene Jules (1901 − 1982)

Fuller, Buckminster  (p372 Gaithes)

Nature has made certain things which we call natural, and everything else is “man-made” ergo artificial. But what one learns in chemistry is that Nature wrote all the rules of structureing; man does not invent chemical structuring rules; he only discovers the rules. All the chemist can do is find out what Nature permits, and any substances that are thus dveleope or discovered are inherently natural. 
In the Buckminster Ruller Reader p 318
Jonathan Cape, London, England 1970

Carson, RAchel p361 Gaithes

The chemicals to which life is asked to make its adjustment are no longer merely the calcium and silica and copper and all the rest of the minerals washed out of the rocks and carried in rivers to the sea; they are the synthetic creations of man’s inventive mind, brewed in his laboratories, and having no counterparkts in nature.

Crick, Francis
Nowadays most people know what DNA is, or if they don’t know it must be a dirty word, like “chemical” or “synthetic”

Here’s a definition of “chemophobia” coined by Don McKinnon, CEO of Ciba-Geigy, in 1981: “the almost spontaneous negative response that occurs when people hear the words chemicals and chemical company.”

England and all civilised nations stand in deadly peril of not having enough to eat. As mouths multiply, food resources dwindle. Land is a limited quantity and the land that will grow wheat is aboutely dependent on a difficult and capricious natural phenomena... I hope to point a way out of the colossal dilemma. It is the chemist who must come to the rescue of the threatedned communities. IT is through the laboratory that starvation my ultimately be turned into plent... the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen is one of the great discoveries awaiting the genius of chemists.

Surprisingly, history is much more difficult than chemistry.
