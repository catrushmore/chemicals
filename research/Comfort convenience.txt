Reminders from this book
	Free time - the time that you yourself can schedule to do what you want
	Free time is increasingly fragmented, often by labour / time saving devices which require moments of time and periods of inattention
	Convenience - the meaning of convenience changes, has been about ease of use, saving time, allowing  flexibility, less mess
	What is socially acceptable or normal within a family unit changes over time as other systems change. E.g. showering requires a warm room = central heating, as ch becomes more widespread, so does showering. Therefore showering becomes normal.
