Mothers and Daughters of Invention

Women are very involved in invention and development of technology is the argument of this book. Here are a few examples relating to the development of tools and machinery for use in gardens/ agriculture. Also a possible explanation given for why the numbers of women patenting equipment (the measure - though has some limitations)

.. presumably as the small family farms gave way to agribusiness, and farm machinery tended increasingly to be the costly products of design engineersâ€¦ women's formal and documented role in this area of agricultural technology hit a new low.  Women's Bureau Study (WB/28) women invented and patented machinery and equipment - inc fertilizer/insecticde spreader and fertiliser distributor 

Women of 19thC America improved hand-cultivating tools - e.g. Elizabeth Buckley revolutionised method of making scythes shovels etc - first sheet iron shovel and process for making tools out of sheet iron instead of forging each individually. Early 20thC - 27 patents for garden tools.  

Many chemical inventions in 20thC
