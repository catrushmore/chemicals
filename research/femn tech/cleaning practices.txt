Lydia Martens (2007) argues that cleaning is built upon three cultural priorities: countering germs; taste and aes- thetics; and concerns over ease of cleaning. She found that people ap- proached cleaning in different ways. Some sought to continually keep on top of the cleaning to create order, while others needed to reach a threshold of visible dirt to compel them to clean. Interestingly, many people—particularly those with children—focused less on aesthetics and more on hygiene, both as an act of care and risk management, but also a means of efficiency, to limit unnecessary cleaning to create more time with their family (Martens 2007).    Martens, Lydia. 2007. “The Visible and the Invisible: (De)regulation in Contemporary Cleaning Practices.” In B.
