scouts / guides movements

Is this worth pursuing? Did they properly encourage people to continue activities in their own homes? Or was it mainly to engage with activities in environments other than their own domestic settings? 

Take a look at some of the documents I’ve identified at the Bodlian to see whether they list badges and whether photography and other true chemical investigations are listed. This is what I’ve been looking for and have been unable to locate: a simple list / description of badges and what is entailed. 

This would help me to decide whether the activities helped to reflect the (decreasing) availability of chemicals and perhaps also a way of communication or instilling an attitude towards chemicals in young people, other than school. Leaders might have had other attidtudes or epereinces as compared to immediate family or school teachers.
