Chemistry setsStinks/Bangs (America)mid-1950s advertising slogan that there was a chemistry set in every house on every street in suburban Amercia.Strikingly coloured boxes, smart-looking, well-dressed young boys, exuding the confidence that the field of chemistry was feeling at the time.Advertising space – usually comicbooks, Popular science magazine and other pubs aimed at children.Scouts promoting the sciences – badges – optics, engineeringTV – educational programming  -Watch Mr Wizard, easily recreatable tricks/exptsLate 1950s – being a scientist was not enough – space race, nuclear power.1960s concerns over safety had – parents did not want their children to be playing with loose chemicals or attempting to bend glass tubing with an alcohol lamp in the basement. Govt regulation of chems fundamentally Changed the make up of the sets and therefore the possible experiments. Author points to Silent Spring and thalidomide, air poln as a reason for negative associations with the word chemical. 1980s surge – public interest in science began to re-emerge – smaller sets, fewer chemicals, if any at all. Later, Harry Potter, kitchen chemistry and grossology. Computer and web based components began to take home experimentation in a new direction although not the same kind of free experimentation. Magice/ MasculinityStandard initiating function for career in scienceIncreasingly litigious society  - the perceived decline of chem sets and chemistry in general is a measure of thisGenerally go through the references of this paper – material culture, gender, advertisingVon Korff, R.
