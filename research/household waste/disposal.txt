What has been the situation of tips/ dumps taking chemicals? e.g. weedkillers, batteries, unfinished solvents, white spriti etc?	
		Where would I find this information? 
				Local authority - Oxford, archive? 
				Hansard? 
				oral history - what do people say they did/ thoughg they should do/ think about it?


Museums - I expect people will have tried to approach museums to get rid of chemicals in sheds/ attics after someone has died, either as examples of chemicals from the time, or being unsure of how to dispose of them privately.
