Adverts

The adverts in Good Housekeeping seemed to be mainly for polishes, whether furniture, floor, tile, silver, rather than for cleansers. The polishes have cleansing and sometimes antiseptic actions, but they are polishes. The Goddard polishes also typify or embody a couple of tropes about cleaning - the adverts in the 1970s say “you have better things to do than polish” and also “if we thought one polish would do, we wouldn’t make four”. They had moved from craftsmen type messages to consumer / use messages. 

The number or frequency for household chemical products also decreased considerably, over the time period I am studying. There were many adverts for polishes, sprays and disinfectants but they declined. Zal (a disinfectant) referred to the 1970 ongoing outbreak of Salmonella in it’s advertisting, in the sample I selected they hadn’t advertised in GHK since 1955. This kind of public health message is employed by other products - “living more closely” in Harpic

Efficiency, whether fuel or personal effort is a recurring them. Kleenoff 

Stain removal products have not been encountered in the products advertised in the sample I chose. Even when there were articles or features on stain removal, there were not accompanying adverts for grease solvents, or other specialiased products or nonspecialiased chemcials.  

In the 1975 feature on stain removal, this is the first time that propriatery products are actually named (in the smaple that I studied). Not all products get a propriatry name check - bleaches and grease solvents do, but
laundry borax, meths, hydrogen peroxide, household ammonia, Fuller’s Earth, talc detergents do not.

Warnings about poison - “Practically all stain removers are poisonous”
lists
washing powder, laundry borax, hydrogen peroxide, glycerine, meths, white vinega, household ammonia, turps - in separate side bar goes into detail about which are flammable and therefore not to smoke, keep acetic acid off skin, not to use certain things on certain fabrics, that meths is poisonous. So, out of all these tings, only meths is actually named as poisonous.
