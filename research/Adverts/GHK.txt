p46 safety first in the home
1930 National safety first show the greatest number of accidents were due ot falls of one kind or another. Next come accidendets due to drowning burns and scalds while considerably fewer are hose due to suoffocation, poisongin, explosions and firearms and misc causes. 
various polishes o nthe marekte which the makers claime to be nonslip but the majority of these unfortunately have a varnish basis, with the result that t brilliant shine is produced at first then begins to loks shappy. We usually advise readers to contineu with a wax polish to to thin this down well with turps or decco-turps, a turps substitue obtainable at builders merchants. In this way a soft reamy product results if the polish is well mixed and beaten, which there is no diffiuclty in aplying sparingly to the floor. The majority of maids use polish far too lavishly, iwth the result that not only is it wasted but the floor acquires a greasy appearance and is apt to be very slippery. 
p120 article continued. 
burns and scalsds - only hot/fires
use of inflammable cleaning solvents such as petrol is another cause of fire. There is no necessity watever to use such a solvent for dry clenaing since carbon tetrachloirde or one of the prepared products having this chemical as a base, is more staifacoty (although unfortunately more expenseive)  and is of such a non inflamable nature that it is the liquid used in conjunction with fire extinguishers.

a pathetic feature of Curies death was that in a sense she was her own immolator upon the altar of mortality. The rays upon which she so constantly worked attacked her own bones and she died as a form of pernicious anaemia as a result. It can have been given to a few others if any to live for humanity and likelwise to die for it.

Can you let me know about the ingredients for foam baths for reducing? 
It is necessary to have an apparatus for producing th efoam, and this can be hired for 50s for the first month and 30s for the subsequent motnhs. The actual chemial substances used in producing the foam costs 1s each bath. It is really much simpler and better to take a course of the baths at the london salon if you can do so.

To make doubly sure howver an dantiseptic should be added to the paste used in sticking on the wallpaper. Ordinary flour paste is an excellent food for moulds but if a small amount of carbolic acid is added to the paste this will kill anny mould spores.
