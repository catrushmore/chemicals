p46 safety first in the home
1930 National safety first show the greatest number of accidents were due to falls of one kind or another. Next come accidents due to drowning burns and scalds while considerably fewer are hose due to suffocation, poisoning, explosions and firearms and misc causes. 
various polishes on the market which the makers claimed to be nonslip but the majority of these unfortunately have a varnish basis, with the result that t brilliant shine is produced at first then begins to looks shabby. We usually advise readers to continue with a wax polish to to thin this down well with turps or decco-turps, a turps substitute obtainable at builders merchants. In this way a soft creamy product results if the polish is well mixed and beaten, which there is no difficulty in applying sparingly to the floor. The majority of maids use polish far too lavishly, with the result that not only is it wasted but the floor acquires a greasy appearance and is apt to be very slippery. 
p120 article continued. 
burns and scalds - only hot/fires
use of inflammable cleaning solvents such as petrol is another cause of fire. There is no necessity whatever to use such a solvent for dry cleaning since carbon tetrachloride or one of the prepared products having this chemical as a base, is more satisfactory (although unfortunately more expensive)  and is of such a non inflamable nature that it is the liquid used in conjunction with fire extinguishers.

The passing of Marie Curie - most important woman who has ever lived. 
extracted radium
polonium
a pathetic feature of Curies death was that in a sense she was her own immolator upon the altar of mortality. The rays upon which she so constantly worked attacked her own bones and she died as a form of pernicious anaemia as a result. It can have been given to a few others if any to live for humanity and likewise to die for it.

Can you let me know about the ingredients for foam baths for reducing? 
It is necessary to have an apparatus for producing the foam, and this can be hired for 50s for the first month and 30s for the subsequent months. The actual chemical substances used in producing the foam costs 1s each bath. It is really much simpler and better to take a course of the baths at the lLndon salon if you can do so.

Counteracting moulds and mildews - prevention focuses on jam making and keeping bread and cheese properly. 
Walls - cured by stripping wallpaper and painting the plaster with ordinary water-glass. This as  rule makes the wall damp proof and thus deprives the moulds of one of thier essential articles of food. To make doubly sure however and antiseptic should be added to the paste used in sticking on the wallpaper. Ordinary flour paste is an excellent food for moulds but if a small amount of carbolic acid is added to the paste this will kill any mould spores.

Mothproofing treatment for fabric - special textile symbol that looks like a stick man holding a sword and shield
certain textile dyes appeared to give protection, led to a search for a colourless compound. Mitin is one of these. Normally applied to articles during manufacture although it is possible to be applied during dry cleaning. Clothes, blankets and carpets are immune to moths indefinitely even after washing dry-cleaning or constant wear. Another well known mothproofing process is Cataphrene.

unlike Nature to waste effort and if she sees fit to load the normal body tissues with histamine it is quite possible that histamine serves some useful purpose. Until science has more information on the function of this natural histamine in the body and the effect if any that the antihistamine drugs have on it it would be well to treat warily and seek medical advice before resorting to their use.

No significant effect on the nutritional value of the food. Nor is there, as yet, any concrete evidence that the modern treatment of livestock by inoculations, antibiotics or hormone injections (the last are seldom used) harms our health , although many docits do question this and we feel it is important that more research should be done.

We could find little evidence of cruelty. Living in warm dry clean conditions sheltered,adequately supplied with air, food and water. 

Ill treated animals do not thrive. 
A book on the subject pleads that mechanical cleaning reduces the sense of unity the stockman has with his cattle. mucking out, when we did it, never produced such rapport.
