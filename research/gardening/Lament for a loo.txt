Allotment and Leisure Gardener

A little while ago down Capel St Mary way some members asked if it were possible to have a toilet on the local allotment site. Barratt, who confessed to having been, among other hazardous occupations, a war-time Army Hygiene Officer, was asked to investigate and report on the prospect. This is his verbatim report:

Lament for a loo on the allotment

A toilet all complete with flush and pan, 
all shining white and gleaming spick  and span, 
In situation here would be ideal, 
but too expensive quite by far I feel, 
To build a privy water pipes and sewer
Which Local Regualtions would endure.

Now were it just a place for men 2P, 
Then very little problem I would see;
A fourfoot screen preserving decency, 
A basic hole - and ooh la la oui oui!

But for ladies 'twould be far too crude, 
Indelicate and really rather rude;
Sophisication in the offing flickers
That she, in private can remover her anorak
And answer nature's call with calm and ease 
Whilst she works among the cabbages and pease. 

Now:-
It's quite an esay matter with frivolity to chatter
Of these things to which this briefly is related, 
But the natural phenomena of feminine abdomina
Is apt to make it rather camplicated. 

It's a matter of some gravity to be without a 
	lavotory
When relief by nature man or woman seeks, 
Considering it desirable in privacy retirable
When a call is very pressitn it is simply no good guessing 
Just where they'll coyly sit and plant their leeks .

So to spend a pretty penny the options are not 
	many, 
To dignify the Matrons pure of mind, 
And a policy that's pracial, economic and 
	attractable, 
Is one I must confess I cannot find.
