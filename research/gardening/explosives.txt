This book is a generally informative book about the history of commercially used expslosives, not a how to manual although someone who was sufficiently determined and wantign to experiment might be able to have a crack at producing a functional eplosive. 

Mainly it is things to look out for or to understand about explosions, which was possibly interesting to people who were in the midst of war and hearing about grenade attacks etc.
