Visit to BL - Thursday 23 May

Looking at gardening annuals to see if there are any changes in the advice given re. chemicals, use of, storage, buying from where, precautions.

If you finish early, look to see if there are any sales figures/ where there might be reviews of books or annuals

If it strikes you, look at the Kelly’s / Slaters directories as you did in Reading - take copies as these are NOT online (if they are, they aren’t on the uniofLeicester site)

Find out what time the conference starts on Monday, Book somewhere to stay for De Montford either just Monday night or Sunday and Monday.
