 p18 Lime and Liming
 ...Lime was known to the ancients as a sweetner of the soil and although they did not know the ;reason why' they profited by the results of applying it. We today are so concerne with probing into the reasons for everythig that we are inclied to minimise the impc of th eeffects. We sometimes behave rather like the inquiisitive man on the sinking linker whose investigation into the cause of the leak took hi into the hold and eventually to the bottom of the sea while the rest of hte crew escaped. 
 If every tiller of the soil no matter what size his holding would get firmly into hi shead the aciom "Lime is the basis of soil fertility" the hope of every thoughtful person for this country to become as nearly as possible self supporting would at once be brought out of the realm of faerie  and into thos of practial politics.

 p3 limes such as "Limbux" "hydrate limes - prep by treating very pure hot lime with water. For small users this form is perhaps the best in which to buy lime sinci it is specailly prep for them, is perfectly safe and clean to handle and is obtainable in bags. Lime is nomrally sold in bulk in six ton trucloads for ag o r ind use. Thus the smallholder is in difficulty if he only promoses to lime say half and acre. For him the proprierty brand of hydrated lime should alswys be the choice

 p1  editorial - Soil Testing
 long felt need amongst plotholders and gardeners for a simple yet effieicnt soil testing device which would show clearly the various degrees of acitiy and alkalinity (sweetness) in soils. The NAS has a leaflet on the subject buty what is far better, it can supply an excellent unit, invented by an agricultual chemit so that gardeners may quite easily carry out their own tests. The price is 1s 2d post free of 1s if societies order quantities.

 this is where we see the first ref to patriotism - 
 Good deal of interst shown in the sheme this year by local authorities and allotment orgs. 'the men on the plots' 
 what a difference attnetion to little thigns makes - the weekeing of paths, gatheing up and burning of rubbish
 The spring cleaning germ which attacks women at this part of the year - or something like it - seems to have infected the men on the allotments as well. If we go on at this rate man of our allotments will be as attractive as public gardens - and why shouldn't they be?

 p12 in reporting on Conference
 A recommendation to the Central Allotments Committee to offer as an alternative choice an organic fertilizer in addition to the chemical one already supplied under the Assistnace Scheme was brought forward by the Barnsley Federation. Mr Casper, Barnsley, proposing, said that htis wa a long felt want. To continte to does land with this highly concnetrated chemical substance supplied under the shceme was like the habitiual taking of asprin tablets: there came a time when itdid more harm htna good. He also dalt with the objections against the proposal, and concluded by stating that by the continued use of the fertilizer supplied more was being taken out of th eland than was being put on. Mr Bland, Derby seconded. mr Purvis Monmouth who i s an expert on these matters was then asked by the chairman ot give th eConverence the benefit of his k and experience. 
 All manure he said are good bt some are better than others. the fert supplied under the scheme was the best value obtainable. fcourse itneeded balanceing wiht organic matter but a good gardener had this ready to hand in the  form of clean waste veg matter... A great number of organic fertilizers were on the market which in porportion to thier bulk were highly expensive and of very little real value to the allotment holder. He warned deleates agaoinst the specious advertier. The resltuion was then voted on and lost.

 soil tet for lime - take a dozen very small samples of soil from different parts of the plot, mix them up well, place a small quantity in a tumbler and pour on it a wineglassful of muriatic acid (easily obtainable). If the liquid fizzes and bubbles freely there is suffieicnt lime presetn. If it does not buggle or only feebly, a liberal dressing of lime is necessary.

 We must grow more... numerous difficulties in the way ARP LDV long working hours and all the rest of it. Yest difficulties are made to be overcome and right well they are doing it in some places.

 urgency of spraying potatoes as safeguard against late blight. Bordeaux mix and burgandy mix are two reliable wet sprays while colloidal copper dust applied through hand bellows is a good powder spray.... in certain industrial districts sprayin ginjures the foliage. Happily in these districts the disease is not a menace. I suggest that local enquiry be made as to the advisability of spraying.

 Growing for victory
 .. deplorable practice: people hwo should be cultivating their own plots but are too idel or indifferent to do so. In certain part of the country large numbers of these people are invading allotments and buying up surplus produce grwon by allotment holders. It is unpatriotic to *dig for drones* who ought to dig for themselves.
