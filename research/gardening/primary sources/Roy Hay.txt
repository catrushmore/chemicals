Roy Hay

Columnist for The Times
	or was this syndicated? 
	
	He wrote the Readers Digest Year in the Garden, so it would probably have been fairly easy to reuse some of this content. 
	
 In 1936 he became assistant editor for the Gardeners' Chronicle (which became Horticulture Week). The Chronicle moved to Reading after the outbreak of the Second World War and Roy began to edit for various publications of the Royal Horticultural Society. 
 
 In 1940 he was recruited by the Ministry of Agriculture and spent two years on their "Dig for Victory" campaign. 
 
 In 1942 he was appointed the horticultural officer to Malta when the Siege of Malta began. 
 
 In 1945 Roy went on to become controller of horticulture and seeds division for the British zone in occupied Germany
 
He returned to the Gardeners' Chronicle and in 1956, Hay succeeded the formidable editor Charles H Curtis as its editor, a position he would hold until 1964. In this role he was assisted by Robert Pearson and was known to be a stickler for accuracy.

Roy Hay also presented the BBC radio programme Home Grown, with Fred Streeter, that occupied the two o'clock slot on Sunday afternoon and was later to be occupied by Gardener's Question Time. On this show he came into regular contact with the contributor to the programme, Frances Perry [garden columnist for The Observer for 20+ yrs] whom he married in 1977. They were long standing colleagues and together visited many countries.

Died, 1989.

So when he refers to ground cover in "their garden" it's working with Frances. They must have fairly similar approaches then? Can see that in the Observer columns?
