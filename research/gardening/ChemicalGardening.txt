Chemical Gardening

Written in 1943, this book promotes the benefits of gardening without soil, i.e. different versions of hydroponics, sand culture and pumice culture. He says that he recieved hundreds of letters from housewives who wanted to know more about soilless growing. It sounds like it would be harder than normal gardening, as have to mix up solutions, it’s not exactly cheap, although you can allegedly use any containers you like “glass jars covered with crepe paper” vases, ceramic pots, “even an old cheese box”. 

Amounts are given for industrial growing and also 5 gallon mixtures. However, the Sources of chemicals he gives are essentially unhelpful (p35)- advises to contact nearest fertiliser manufacturing company, how would this go down?!  Gives compositions of commercial fertilisers deemed good for nuturent solution

ammonium sulphate (NH4)2SO4
Ammonium nitrate (NH4O3
Sodium nitrate NaN03
Potassium nitrate KN03
Calcium nitrate Ca(NO3)2
etc


When giving recipies for sand culture,5 gallon amts (which seems suitable for housewives) the advice is to use fertiliser or commercial grade salts (food grade also occurs in some instances) - superphosphate, sodiucm nitrate, epsomsalts (Mag sulphate) and muriate of potash. 

If the sand it sinnert, make up a solution of minor nutrients using boric acid, manganess sulfate and zinc sulphate (measured as 0.8 grams each - who would have the equipment to measure this accurately in 1943?) 

Although published in London, the information is American centric and also unlikely to be relevant on a domestic scale. It might be interesting to find out if anybody took up chemical gardening in this way in UK, or whether it really didn’t take off.
