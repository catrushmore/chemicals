looks at parodies of Silent Spring, which assume that she advocated a complete ban
	A Desolate Year from Monsanto - giving 9 examples of the benefits of pesticides, asserting that misuse, not routine large scale use, causes problems
	Quiet Summer - American Agriculturalist - explaining that a book called QS caused a return to natual living that brought of malaria, famine, blightm famine, death ofthe boys parents
	
various examples of professional disdain and distaste

but public reaction was positive, as were reviews in pop press (US)
“by provoking horror in its readers it was startling them into action” p375
		but what action did the general public actually take - no example given of general public either using then choosing not to use DDT in their homes, or that they demanded products be grown without the chemical, no aecdotes from shop keepers or demonstrable decreases in volume of domestic preparations containing DDT sold. 
		
drew on nuclear fallout - strontium-90 and images of white dust falling from the sky liek snow, followed by plant and animal deaths
