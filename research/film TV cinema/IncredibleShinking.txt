BBC 6.50 [pm] The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957. One of the most imaginative of science fiction films, in which a man gets smaller and begins to see the creatures he has abused (spiders, flies, etc.) as the menacing monsters he must have seemed to them.

Rivalry in hollywood studios is becoming so intense that plans to make the increible shrinkig woman are being countered by Columbia Warner with the incredible meltin man. I await the response in similar inventiv vein by other studios.

Film Review
Sometime, maybe, Lily Tomlin will find a flm worht of her penetrating comic talent. This isn’t it, although I can quite see that it promised well in the blue-print stage. In 1957 Jack Arnold’s Incredible Shrinking Man produced a chilling fantasy of an increasingly threatening every day world viewed by a hero who, through exposure to radiation grew smaller and smaller. Jane Wagner’s new screen play updates the idea and casts a harassed suburban mother and houseiwfe as the mini-heroine. Infeted by those chemicals you read about on  supermarket packets, she wastes away inch by inch, becomes the nation’s pet freak and is kidnapped by evil minded scientists who want to dominate the Earth by shriveling its inhabitants. But, like its main character, the film suffers from a severe case of diminishing returns. In the sterile role of the husband torn between his job and loyalty to his wife, Charles Grodin looks uncomfortably as if he’d rather be somehwere else. [reviewed between Foxes and Rough Treatment]

Lily Tomlin made her name as a comic telephonist in ‘Laugh In’ and boy, does she geta wrong number here. It takes the original science fiction classic and hijacks it as a feminist comedy broadside where the laughts are as diminitive as the heroine’s eventual height.
