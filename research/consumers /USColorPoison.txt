p21 Had you read the NYT on June 26 1947... Trailing not too hard afte rthe sports pages was the “News of Food” section, devoted primarily to recipes, articles on new product and household information. It wasn’t much of a setion and easy to pass by, but the most dutiful of readers  might have noticed a small Associated Press item tucked into the extreme right hand corner of page 26:

“New Law to Color Poisons

A bill requiring color in some poisons to lessen the chance of housewives putting bug instead of baking powder in to their biscuits became law today. Preseidnet signed the measure which tightens a 1910 insecticide control law, bringing rat and weed poisons under the act. It also requires coloring of any dangerous poisons that might be mistaken for flour sugar salt and the like, registration of poisions before they go on the market and warning labels.” 

Few probably took much note of this rather innocuous item - even I imagine, the housewife to whom it evidently was directed. This coloring law was the Federal Insecticide, Fungicde and Rodenticide Act of 1947 FIFRA, a major action aimed a a broad spectrum of chemicals then entering the postwar economy. That FIFRA received so little attnetion in the national news may in retrospect seem surprising but it indicates how the issue of pesticides at that time was defined and how it ranke din the public eye.
