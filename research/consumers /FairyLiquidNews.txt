For three and a half years the firm of Tham Hedley have been owrking on a new washing up liqued which is now perfected and being marketed as Fary Liquid. They claim the 700 formulas have been tested and 20 000 housewives have been continually conulted at all stages of development, so I think you will agree tthat the end result hould be good I think it is. Fariy Liquid is green and it has a fresh clean smell. It is packed in an easy to use unbreakabel plastic bottle. Fairy Liquid dissolves quickly formas a good head of suds and gives a clear solution without lime scum and without an “over slippery” feel. The Company say that they have achieved their object of porducing a washign up liquid which removed grease quickly and effieicntly and prevetns its being redeposisted on dishe. To denote its special mildness the new prouct has been given the famous Fairy name which has been used by Thoams Hedley for more than fifty years. Fairly liquid osts 1s 6d and 2s 6d and is on sale everywhere except in the West Country.
