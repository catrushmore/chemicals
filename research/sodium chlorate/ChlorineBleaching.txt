Obstacle in the Establishment of Chlorine Bleaching 

Claude 0Louis Bethollet 1780s chlorine ans bleaching agent for industrial proceses

not adopted by textile industry for a while

bleachign of linen - long and drawn out.
soap - souring (to neturalise alkali in soaf) rinsing, water extraction then grassing or crofting - exposure to sunlight. 2-5 months. Bottleneck, wasteful. 

previous linear models of chlorine bleaching - tech determinism
devt of chlorine into usable bleaching agent is imagined to have followed almost immediately by its practical application to the textiles industry. 
	advances in chemical sciences led directly to improvement in tech applications, which saw radical changes in industry
	 
	 social shaping of technology offered as an alternative to tech determinism, stressing that it is not social determinism in which soc is the sole determinant of technological outcomes . Recognising mutual influecnes between sci, soc, and tech. 
	 
	France - problems iwth quipment, difficult to control, giving unreliable results meant that chlorine bleaching was slow to be adopted
	risks to workers  p160 gives a description by C. Pajot Deschamres “on of those who attempted to develop Berthollets’ process”  - -  does this mean he’s a scientist or a textile worker? 
	adding potash alleviated “the smell of chlorine gas escaping from the solution” also made it stronger and more reliable. 
	practice of bleaching should be only those who were instructed in chemisty - exclude lay artisands of the industiral workfore.   
	
	local croft bleachers put Bonjour out of business n Valenciennes
	
	careful to demonstrate that the new pbleaching process was to go absolutely hand in hand with traditional methods but p163 says that no provision was made fo any widespread instruction in chemistry, and majority of workforce therefore lacked the skills to participate
