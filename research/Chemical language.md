Chemical language
Look at the language used to describe products on the labels of the packaging or in promotional material. Are there any patterns in the use of anti / pro chemical language? When is my earliest chemical-free reference? What are some of the most common misunderstandings portrayed? Chemical freeSolvent free	Water is a solvent, in fact the universal solvent. http://www.snowdoniasupplies.co.uk/cgi-bin/view_larger.pl?ref=CP26 No info on sheet as to ingredients which states that all chemicals are potentially harmful, bottle has an X logo, Constrain does not give off any toxic fumes as it is water basedhttp://restore-products.co.uk/ecommerce/product/constrain_spray_pest_controller/
