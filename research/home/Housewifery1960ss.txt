Weeds how to get rid of weeds

thanks to modern weedkillers the gardeners ‘task’ is a comparatively simple one in the fight against weeds. to obtain the fullest benefit from weedkillers it is necessary to appreciate the three main types availab le and the way in which they work. These are total, selective and pre-emergent (often kown as residual). 

total - most powerful , most useful on vacant ground wheere weed groth partiuclarly heavy. Sodium chlorate so powerful that ground must not be usef or at least 6mo afterwards. 
two main types of selective weedkills - kill many plants other than grasses, and another which works theother way round. 

2, 45T, 24D and MCPA are used for selective work on lawns. Dalapon is the chemical which will kill grass but not other plants. 

Simazine supproessor - pre emergent. 

selective weedkiller, total weekillers and the use of your trsuty hoe will soon put you in control!
