ICI - the company that changed our lives (2nd Ed)

Paraquat – ici  
p.10 production of soda ash – Solvay process vs Leblanc process. Solvay produces better soda ash, but Leblanc has useful byproduct of chlorine, used in bleaching esp textiles. Leblanc companies amalgamated to become the United Alkali Company in 1891 but was quickly weakened when they did not react to the advancements in technology and process that meant others could produce chlorine.
p.15  nitrogen market collapsed in the 1930s making Billingham a millstone 
1924 – Lever Bros find out that Brunner Mond have been selling cheaper alkali to CWS, despite promising Lever Bros it would  not. Settled out of court in 1925. 
p.113 very few products made by ICI go directly to the consumer in the high st – Weedol garden herbicide and Dulux paint are a couple of examples.
p.110 new materials were stiffer and less flexible and could not be used for exaple for cable insulation or the new squeezy bottles for washing up liquid which were developed in the early and mid 1950s from the older versions of polythene. But they soon found an important market in the mfcr of rigid bottles for milk, bleach and other liquids…
p102 − 106 MDI foam made by ICI enabled refrigeration to progress – refrigerators could become more sleekly designed as well as cheaper, frozen foods began to take off as more people were able to afford fridge freezers. Hurd’s staff of 2 lab assistnats expanded into staff of 140 in Manchester, 60 in Brussels as the full commercial potnetial of MDI chemistry was recognised. Hurd acted as expert witness (?) re foams and their toxicity and flammativility (1985 Airtours crash, 1979 Woolworths fire),
Synthetic fibres and synthetic dyes – fashion and colour after the rationing and drab colours of the WW2
p.100-1 detergents were first marketed for the housewife under brand names in 1951 – they had been developed during the war as substitutes for saop and the result was a wash day revolution as coppers, washboards and metal buckets boiling on the stove in steamfilled kitchens becamse a thing of the past for many people. Reflecting in 1986 on the greatest changes in his lifetime, ICI’s top research scientist Prof Derek Birchall singled out the disappearance of wash-day which might in fact stretch to four days if weather prevented outdoor drying on the line. 

p158 onwards
focus on CFCs - development work on alternatives to CFCs had slowed down by the end of the 1970s when opionion was divided on the risk factor. Discovery of hole in ozone layre accelerated the presure to eliminate CFCs. All major chem cos started to race to fine alternatives. ICI announced in 1988 to phase out production of CFCs. ICI decided not to develop a group of products called HCFCs  as thought that they would eventually be considered acceptable (true) and that society would drive for perfection. Went to work on HFCs - KLEA 134a  (first developed in Runcorn in the 1970s, then experimented with at Widnes in 1987 to commercial production in Runcorn 1990) and KLEA 32. 


**Chris Hampson** ICI board, responsibility for environment
Greenpeace called for the end to production of chlorine by 1993 (‘chlorine-free by ’93’). Unrealistic though that always was, chlorine production is likely to become smaller industry (1.7m tonnes 1992 from ICI) as end uses for chlorine disappear. 
p164 - haven’t got life cycle analysis in hand quite yet but working on it. 

**Denys Henderson** chair of ICI since 1987 “What it amounts to is that society has added a new imperative o which every company must conform if it is to retain its licence to operate. For that reason, sucess in managineg the environmental impact of what we do is an essential element in measuring the overall success of the corporation. It is therefore as important and indispensable an area in which to invest as, say, research and evelopment, or training, or process technolgy. Each contributes to our competititveness.”  (p164)

p165   Even complieance iwth law and regulation means moving forward as legislatio changes so fast. Beyond compliance, ICI put in place 4 objectives to environmental imporivement. Including ICI expand waste recycling programmes not onliny inhouse but incollaboration with ICI’s customers - free recovery and recycling programmes fo rindutrial users of CFC and a recycling scheme in the UK for regrigerant recovered from domestic fridges.  “We cannot afford not to do it.... Environmentla performance is not a matter of choice. It is a precondition for remaining at the forefront of he chemical industry. ‘ Costs have to be paid for. Chemical industry has always lived by innovation. Solution to an environmental problem can open up buiness opportunities.’

p166 Biopol - ofshoot of the costly Pruteen experiment. in the 1970s. biodegradable plastic. Non oil based, but price of oil stabilised then fell and more oil supplies came onstream. The world passed PHB by. 

p167 in 1990 ICI doubled capacity of Group Environmela Lab at Brixham. It has since the mid 1960s changed role from testing paint to coporate research on the enviionment. Prinicpal activities are investigating the safe and effective treatment of all types of chemical waste, monitoring the effect of ici operations on the local ecology, computer modelling to track effluent discharges and how they disperse and detailed environmental assessment of ICI products. 

Christmas 1989 brown plumes of gas, a component of smog inducin nitrogen oxides (ox) that used to flow into the air above ICI’s complex on Teesside disappeared for ever. Its removal was more PR than benefit ot envronment - gas stream contirubed less than 10% total ox emissions from the Teeside plant but was a powerfully viislbe symbol. 

Teeside had been chosen by ICI for the ease of disposal it offered to get rid of chem waste into the river and estuary. Pollution recued during the 1970s an 80s though ICI did nt have an installint to clean the water as some Dutch and German plants had. 

p169   Virtually all ICI’s resarch spending now has envr imporvemnt as a principal objective. In 1992 ICI pbulished first report on progress towards env objectives. Giving data on waste and emissions wherever the company ofperates tna the number of prosecutions on environmental charges. Many chem cos claim that env stats are too difficult to collect and interpret for public consumption but ‘If we’re goign to gain the publics’ trust, then we have to publish the results.’
