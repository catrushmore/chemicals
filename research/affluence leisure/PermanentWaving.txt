Permanent Waving
The golden years - louis calvete

trial and error - alkaline reagent favoured, caustic soda used by Nessler, to milder materials such as borax. Ammonia became a preferred material - did not leave a residue. 

Bari-Wools, reducing agents better than alkali = sulphites, also allow lower steaming temperature or reduced steaming time. 
thioglycollic acid  - powerful reducing agent, cold waving.

sulphites - father brought all Bari-Woolls chemicals home where I added them to my chemistry set, inc materials such as sodium sulphite, sodium bisulphite and sodium metabisulphite.
