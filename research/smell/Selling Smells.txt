Selling Smells
Scent Home

I'm really pleased to be here with this work in progress, which is part of my PhD is called Chemicals and their users in the British home, 1930 to the 1980s.  I wanted my work to complement existing studies of mechanical, durable technologies of the home. 
 
Today, I want to look more closely the smells of freshness granted by cleaning, with a quick look at advertisements for some different products that can help freshen spaces, Ozonol air freshener, Harpic toilet cleaner,  Zoflora room disinfectant, and Zal general purpose disinfectant. I have been looking at adverts because I am interested in how the user learns about what to expect from the product and how to use it, so that's where my focus will be. 

Even when we have moved beyond the miasma theory of disease, that disease is caused by bad air, interpreting bad smells as a potential threat to health is no bad thing. When dealing with threats, microbes, too small not visible to the naked eye, an olfactory signal is very helpful, it can hint to the action of microbes. Environmental olfactory impression management is the term given to maintaining control of the smell of rooms, through air fresheners and cleaning to remove the source of the smell. Unclean smells are instantly recognisable as such, so carries meaning that people can quickly form judgements about. Managing these smells demonstrates an awareness of the rules of decorum, they show consideration for others as well as self respect. As more and more houses had inside toilets, there was an attendant problem that smells which could emanate from the bathroom could invade the entire house. 

Suellen Hoye notes that in the United States, products for freshening and cleaning the air began to multiply in the 1950s. Marten and Scott in their survey of the British magazine Good housekeeping, observed this explosion of products too. That's not to say that people didn't care before the 1950s; This Ozonol advert from 1940 promised to freshen and purify air in specifically lavatories, but the manufacturers saw an extra application, which was the Anderson Shelter. Although it says that it will make the lavatory fragrant, this advert doesn't actually indicate what kind of smell we can expect, other than promising sweet, germ free air. It doesn't tell us how that will be achieved, but it does say that its from a laboratory, which makes us think of scientific-ness, that it will work. 

This advert gets straight to the problem of the smell of lavatories. MJ Daunton wrote about the developments of water closets and their migration into the Victorian home, with smells from either from the ineffective clearing of the bowl, or the escape of sewer gas into the house. When the design that we are familiar with today came into use, in 1880, and building regulations stipulated that WCs be indoors, managing the smells of a toilet became especially vital. Victoria Kelley quotes Phillis Brown the author of household manuals as saying that 'water closets need constant attention... the condition of the water closet is a more certain sign of the character of a housekeeper than is any other part of the house'. 

Smells can be eliminated at source, by cleaning, or they can be masked. Fragrance was only added to Harpic toilet cleaner in 1950. There were technical challenges associated with this, as the there were a very limited number of perfumes which would stand up to the acidity of Harpic. Reckitts, the manufacturers, had been keen to  improve the aesthetic value of this product by giving it a pleasant smell of its own for some time, shown by their trying to gauge the importance of fragrance to customers in a market survey of 1935.  In the reasons for using Harpic, smell was not an answer that was given by respondents, only that it is a good or satisfactory cleanser, or habit.

Even though a lot of behind the scenes effort went into developing a perfume blend t this aspect is not elaborated on in their adverts. The senses are directed to the clean visual brightness of the toilet, rather than the smell. Perhaps they were too polite to mention this obvious issue. The focus is on that deadly S-bend with its lurking germs, where you can't see or reach with a brush. The message is to use Harpic every day, although the adverts claim that all it takes a '5 second sprinkle' which is left overnight and flushed in the morning. Note that this isn't a measurement that you can check in any other way, but is entirely dependent on the product packaging, with the sprinkle cap and the contents determining how much actually comes out. The danger with this type of measurement is that you could use too scant an amount, and the acidity generated wouldn't be enough to break down the germ-hiding limescale. This 1950 advert tells users and  potential users, that a new perfumed variant "with fresh fragrance" was being marketed, although the un-perfumed kind was still available.  Fresh is perhaps hard to explain to this group of consumers who as far as they had been concerned, probably had already been making the space smell fresh. 

Jeypine was advertised as being available with other more pleasant floral smells, which they implied were the reason housewives preferred their product. [Martens and Scott p388] The replacement of dirty smells, whether of grease, stale smoke with clean smells signifies that cleaning has taken place. 

Adding smell is another way of the work that has been done being noticed, so not only does something look clean, anyone who has not seen the cleaning take place can't help detecting it with the always active nose. Having housework "noticed" is an important area, a theme which Jessamyn Neuhaus pulls out in her examination of housework and housewives in American advertising. 

In the move from buying simple chemicals, such as washing soda crystals, to buying packaged, specialised preparations, there was also a move to products with smells of their own, and scented products.  
 
 We can see from this 1935 market survey carried out on behalf of Reckitts who made the toilet cleaner harpic, that soda and soap are rarely used, with most people using a disinfectant, cleanser or scourer. [HAT 50/1/147/3/2/7 Lavatory Cleaner Survey No. 556 7 Jan 1960 p1] Reckitts however, were keen to improve the aesthetic value of this product by giving it a pleasant smell of its own. [B. Reckit p83]. 
 


Where the importance of clean smells was really hammered home was in adverts for the multi surface cleaner Zal, which use dramatic story like adverts.  They use the device of a more Zal-experienced person ,who doesn't necessarily have to be older, as we can see in this advert where the daughter Linda who uses Zal at work, persuades her mother to use Zal at home. 

Fairly grown up, engaged Linda is living at home but doesn't make product choices or do the housework, which is left to her mother. Once her mother starts using Zal, Linda's embarrassment at the "stuffiness" of the house dissipates and she can bring fianc√© Noel to the family home. The mother is relieved and happy, vowing to continue using Zal. Stuffiness also has an additional meaning, to hint that the existing cleaning routine was old fashioned. In using Zal, the routine is updated and modernised. 

Stuffiness could be solved by more thorough airing of the house, perhaps cracking open a window. Airing a room will get rid of body odours and emanations quite fast.  However, that wouldn't sell very much Zal. 
In the 1952 there was a smoke fog episode that killed thousands of people, and in 1956 there was a smog that was deemed even worse, stretching from the South Coast up to Yorkshire. Smog wasn't just an outdoor problem, it seeped into people's homes, the particulates settling on surfaces and the gases generally contributing to poor indoor air quality. Perhaps keeping your window shut and bringing pine fresh smells in to it was the better option if you lived in an urban area. 

Another advert in the series has Jacinth's mother enlighten her about the product, perhaps again showing that the daughter was uninvolved in housework while living at home. Newly wed Jacinth had recently moved into her own home and was faced with husband Derek staying out later and later. During a tearful telephone call to her mother (again, a modern convenience - when did telephones become common?) the older woman suggests the reason for the husband's behaviour, one that she had noticed too. She brings Zal to the house and together they cleanse the sink, drains, floors and paintwork - the adverts are careful to list all the places that the product can and should be used - and the daughter is educated by her mother into doing things that she had just not noticed while living at home. Quite a lot of physical work has to go into making the entire house smell pine fresh. 

Here we get to the reason why smelling piney fresh is best - it is because Germs mean smells. "Haven't you noticed?" about being noticed but also about not being able to ones finger on it. 

With the smelly germs banished by Zal, the relationship improved: Derek is always home early now and he praises Jacinth for keeping it fresh and lovely. This is better than not saying anything about it at all.

These exhortations for daily use were not just shaping perceptions of cleanliness, and expectations of practice, or selling more product through using it up faster but were also protecting the manufacturer, as preparations tend to deteriorate the longer they were open, with the chemicals quietly reacting away and losing their potency in the process. If an infrequent user formed the impression of an inefficient product, it was possibly that the level of soil was too great for the amount of active ingredient left in the product to cope with.  
 

Adding a scent required modern chemical techniques, and using these complex, branded chemicals to scientifically speed or ease the task, conferred modernness to the user and their home.  

 
While I was wondering how I came to be writing about smells and toilets  it dawned on me that I spent six years of my working life walking around the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester.  I started work during an travelling exhibition called Grossology, in which one of the interactives was to sniff at bottles and identify the smells correctly - these smells being bad breath, BO, farts, poo and urine. They elicited, among users young and not so young, a level of exuberant, high energy disgust and delight, that I suspect would not be the same as identifying smells related to cleanliness. 

The Underground Manchester gallery is a perennial favourite especially with young visitors.  For people who have yet to visit, it's a gallery running the length of the basement of the Station Master's House, which charts the domestic health issue of clean water and sewerage, and its sponsored by United Utilities. The centre piece is a length of mocked up sewer, complete with stuffed rats and sewer smell (actually "farmyard manure" by Dale Air). Visitors sometimes struggle to find the gallery because as far as they're concerned its The Sewers they're looking for on the museum map, not Underground Manchester. 

There's also a good selection of privies and bathrooms through the ages, a noisy tippler toilet and laundry equipment, including soaps. The subject matter gives a really great range of opportunities for the use of smells, but the convoluted, sometimes hot and stuffy basement atmosphere can get somewhat claustrophobic and could be sensorily overwhelming. What struck me was the focus on the unclean, rather than the clean smells. It could give a completely different meaning to the gallery, but the joy of smells is that they can be temporary, meaning that they can be used to tell different stories.
