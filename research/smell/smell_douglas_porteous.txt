Environmental aestheticians - called for more thought investigation of the env aspects of the non visual senses

house has a characteristic smell readily perceived by visitors, but apparent to the oddupant only after being away for some time. Adaptation, habituation. 
almost all literary descriptions of smells in spaces (not childhood memores - time, not space) are by non-residents/ outsiders. Humanistic study of smell capes, the insider/outsider antimonyy is crucial. 

hedonics - again habituation (familiar / unfamiliar unpleasant)
few smell preferenes are innate, most are learned = importance of cultural adaptation and insideness. 
little evidence that universally pleasant or unpleasant smells xist (exempt almost universal adult dislike of feces odour)]]p91inexplipcable regional differences.

generalised dislikes include man chemical and synthetic smells, esp emitted by chem factories and food processing plants, refineries, garbage dumps, diesel engines. 

spatial vocabulary derived from soundscape studies - smell events, smell marks, eyewitness - nosewitness
visual evidence - hearsay = nosesay
smell walks = historical research must dely on nose witness (compare oral history) but likely that insiders may not be the best widnesses because of habituations. 
one is immersed in a smells cape, immediatelyy evocative, emotional and meaningful. 

describes foreign, outside smellscapes
gasworks in every small English town well after WW2 -gasification of coal - sweet sickly ultimately poisonous smell
working class had to adapt to noxious fumes while the well off moved to suburbs or countryside
