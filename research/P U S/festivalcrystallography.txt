From Atoms to PAtterns
Or The souvenir book of crystal designs

General effect of everything together in the Restaurant was somewhat overwhelming and busy (my opinion looking at the photos) but individually, in some of the products designed the patterns were lovely. How widely available were they made?

However, what was the actual impact of the exercise? 
		Were any lasting relationships made between the industries and the scientists? 
		Were there any attempts to repeat the process outside of the Festival?
		The restaurant was slated for poor quality, expensive food, so how many people would have actually gotten to immerse themselves in the designs here? 
		Perhaps the incorporation of the designs (e.g. ICIâ€™s leathercloth clad benches and PVC cinema seat cover) at the Science Museum exhibition were better appreciated, if they were noticed? Though Dome of Discovery at South Bank did feature crystallography and therefore probably some of the design suppported it there too, not just in the restaurnt.
