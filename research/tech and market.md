Technology and the market
Look at Many Visible Hands and Chlorine in the Doc maybe also How innovative are users. 

p12 References careless technology of the 1960s - present safety reliability and enviro friendlienss of many products and technologies is striking. How did these changes come about? Market mechanism would not have  automaticall led to public interest developments. 
technology as a part of the process, not jsut something that impinges and effects other actors in a network. 

emergence of new sustainable tech and products is a combination of prudence and startegic positioning , not public interest *per se* Hart 1995 analysis 

Including users in development - users introdc their own type of short termism.

p137 raft chemical pulping proces > strong brown fibres which need to be bleached. Chlorine has been the choice sinc ethe 1940s. Bleaching sequence practices in 80’s was established in the 1960s, bleach first with chlorine then chlorine dioxide. rapid switch from chlorine bleaching in late 80s early 90s - discovered that dioxins and other chlorinated organic compounds were discharged. Eliminated within 5 yrs in European countires. 
2 types of altenatives - elemental chlorine free (but still uses chlorine dioxide) - easier transistion, still gives whiteness and brightness or totaly chlorine free (uses hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid) - more expensive.
