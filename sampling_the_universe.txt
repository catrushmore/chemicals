branding is what makes a product more than a commodity, have values over and above the basic function: offer familiarity, reassurance, recognisable. 
1950s - not so clear - growth in the importance of the brand concept has coincided with growth of competitive marketing and increasing freedom of choice. 1980s brands finally received accolade of recognition by accountants in the balance sheet
[but there were many strong brands way before this?]


p154 -  common sense belief that 'fi we could change attitudes, sales would follow' was wrong. Evidence showed that this could also be put the other way round: attitude changes coincide with or even follow behaviour change
marketing was aobu more than getting people to start using the brand - at least as much about reassuring them when they were using it that they were doing the right thing, and building on their satisfied experience. 
p155 advertising has major reassuring and reinforcing function
