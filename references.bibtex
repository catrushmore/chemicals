  __markedentry = {[Cat:6]},
  abstract = {The animal testing protocols used today to evaluate the carcinogenicity
	of chemicals are very different from those used in the earlier part
	of the 20th century. To explore how cancer bioassays have changed
	over time, we surveyed the literature discussing test design and
	interpretation from the 1930s to the present. We also analyzed compendia
	of bioassays published by the US Public Health Service (US PHS) from
	1938 to 1978, and evaluated the data to understand the evolution
	of testing methodology (e.g., animals used, test duration) and the
	types of chemicals being studied. The cancer bioassay evolved in
	several stages. At the beginning of the 20th century, animal bioassays
	were primarily used to re-create known human diseases, whereas in
	the 1940s to 1960s, animal bioassays were largely used to evaluate
	the safety of chemicals in foods, drugs, and cosmetics. Beginning
	in the late 1960s and 1970s, chemicals primarily associated with
	occupational or environmental exposures were also evaluated. Testing
	strategies now emphasize a suite of tests including multiple in vitro
	tests and both short-term and long-term animal tests. The objectives
	of testing are broader, too, with test goals encompassing information
	regarding mode of action and other parameters aimed at evaluating
	potential species differences (e.g., in toxicokinetics) and their
	relevance for evaluating human risks. It is important to consider
	this evolution when evaluating the testing methodology and scientific
	conclusions in earlier eras. As toxicology continues to develop,
	testing methods will continue to change in concert with increased
	knowledge and understanding.},

	concern (TTC) provides a method to determine a conservative estimate
	of a chronic oral exposure below which there is a very low probability
	of risk. The TTC approach was originally developed to support exposures
	to indirect food additives and was based on linear low-dose risk
	estimates to assure protection in the event that the chemical was
	later determined to be a carcinogen. Subsequently, TTC values based
	on noncancer endpoints were proposed for chemicals without structural
	alerts for genotoxicity. The original database supporting the TTC
	values for noncancer endpoints includes >600 structurally diverse
	chemicals. The objectives of this work were to evaluate the applicability
	of the TTC database to ingredients used in consumer products based
	on a comparison of the diversity of chemical structures with those
	in the original TTC database and to confirm that the range of NOELs
	for these ingredients is consistent with the range of NOELs in the

	ingredient structures and confirm that the NOELs for the ingredient
	chemicals are similar in range to the original dataset, supporting

  abstract = {In April, 1964, veterinary surgeon F.D.T. Good offered his first-hand
	account of the ‘Smarden Affair’. Good recounted how, throughout
	1963, he had struggled to explain the sudden deaths of dogs and various
	farm animals near the village of Smarden in the Weald of Kent . This
	paper will examine a local pollution incident in the 1960s, which
	assumed national and international significance. It will assess the
	importance of Rachel Carson and of opposition to insecticides for
	the nascent eco-activist movement in Britain. In particular, it will
	assess the traditional argument that Carson had less impact in Britain
	because of pre-existent governmental measures. Through an examination
	of unpublished governmental papers, district council papers, local
	and national newspapers, and specialist journals, this paper will
	chart the causes and consequences of the Smarden poisoning incident
	in Kent in 1963. In addition to the governmental and expert scientific
	responses, I shall investigate the social, cultural, and political
	implications and impact of this toxic waste incident, which seemed
	to confirm Carson’s dire warnings about the dangers of pesticides;
	and the possible pitfalls of the Green Revolution. As the Smarden
	Affair progressed, veterinary surgeon Good questioned whether science
	was working effectively for agriculture. This paper will place the
	Smarden incident within the broader historical framework of the British
	reception of Silent Spring, the emergence of modern environmentalism,
	and the governmental response to insecticides, pollution, and hazardous
	waste. As its fiftieth anniversary approaches, the ‘Smarden Affair’
	warrants further historical investigation.},

  abstract = {Michel Foucault’s work traces shifting techniques in the governance
	of humans, from the production of ‘docile bodies’ subjected to
	the knowledge formations of the human sciences (disciplinary power),
	to the facilitation of self-governing agents directed towards specified
	forms of self-knowledge by quasi-therapeutic authorities (pastoral
	power). While mindful of the important differences between the governance
	of human subjects and the oppression of nonhuman animals, exemplified
	in nonhuman animals’ legal status as property, this paper explores
	parallel shifts from disciplinary to pastoral regimes of human-‘farmed’
	animal relations. Recent innovations in ‘animal-centred’ welfare
	science represent a trend away from the ‘disciplinary’ techniques
	of confinement and torture associated with ‘factory farms’ and
	towards quasi-therapeutic ways of claiming to know ‘farmed’ animals,
	in which the animals themselves are co-opted into the processes by
	which knowledge about them is generated. The new pastoral turn in
	‘animal-centred’ welfare finds popular expression in ‘happy
	meat’ discourses that invite ‘consumers’ to adopt a position
	of vicarious carer for the ‘farmed’ animals who they eat. The
	paper concludes that while ‘animal-centred’ welfare reform and
	‘happy meat’ discourses promise a possibility of a somewhat less
	degraded life for some ‘farmed’ animals, they do so by perpetuating
	exploitation and oppression and entrenching speciesist privilege
	by making it less vulnerable to critical scrutiny.},

	centuries. This essay argues that our understanding of historical
	science education can be enhanced by exploring twentieth-century
	instruments. It uses the example of Construments sets, with which
	children could build a wide variety of optical instruments from a
	series of standardized parts. Invented by C. W. Hansel, a school
	science master, Construments were founded in and responded to contemporary
	educational practices and debates over "general science," as well
	as addressing characteristic interwar concerns about adaptability
	and economy and older ideals of rational entertainment. By exploring
	the company's instruments, promotional literature, and magazine,
	and by drawing on the memories of contemporary users, I reconstruct
	the contexts in which Construments were used, emphasizing the creation
	of heterogeneous communities vital for the transmission of skills
	and knowledge.},

	Prevention of toxicoses in companion animals follows the same guidelines
	as those recommended for children: Keep cleaning products out of
	the reach of pets, do not leave open containers or solutions of cleaning
	products unattended where animals may get into them, make sure containers
	of cleaning products are tightly sealed and properly labeled, and
	dispose of any cleaning solutions promptly after use. If a companion
	animal has ingested or spilled a cleaning product or disinfectant
	on itself, it is very important to assess the potential hazard to
	the animal promptly. Many products contain warnings regarding the
	corrosive or irritation potential of the product and instructions
	on the label for preliminary action in the case of accidental oral,
	dermal, or ocular exposures in humans. These instructions can generally
	be followed initially until further information on the product can
	be obtained, although the recommendations on some product labels
	may be outdated. In general, the clinical management for toxicoses
	caused by cleaning products and disinfectants involves the prevention
	of further contact with the concentrated product through either dilution
	or bathing; emergency stabilization of the patient if clinical signs
	are present; instituting specific therapies, if available; and use
	of general supportive care.},

	approximately 6000 students per year. Methods--The evaluation was
	based on a post-test only control group design. Three schools were
	chosen as evaluation sites and three served as control settings.
	Students were administered a previously tested, age appropriate questionnaire
	that addressed the goals of the poison lessons. In addition, a survey
	was developed for intervention school parents to determine their
	poison prevention practices. Results--One hundred ninety four intervention
	schoolchildren and 184 control schoolchildren completed the study.
	Children in the intervention schools consistently answered more questions
	correctly than those in the control schools. The parent survey showed
	that the majority have homes that are safe from poisons, although
	fewer than 50% said they had syrup of ipecac in their homes. Conclusions--These
	results show that key concepts related to poison prevention can be
	communicated effectively to primary school students and parents report
	having homes safe from many poisons.},

  abstract = {Whenever I get the blues, I can cheer myself up immediately by being
	thankful that I am not married to a man whose business is household
	efficiency. Can you imagine how awful it would be, for instance,
	to have as a husband the publisher of a women's service magazine,
	who comes home every night with new suggestions for improving your
	own fumbling .household routine? A man who spends his working day
	among time and motion experts and antiseptic test kitchens and experts
	in every field of homemaking? I should think it would give any wife
	a lifelong inferiority complex to be married to a man who knows more
	about housekeeping than she does. Such a man, for instance, as Howard
	S. Cohoon, of Jackson, Miss., who is head of a company which makes
	numerous household products, and who has worked up homemaker's forum
	inviting women all over the country to send in household hints. Now
	don't get me wrong. Cohoon is a charming gentleman, with an attractive
	wife and a happy family consisting of son, daughter and two' grandchildren.
	I am told that Mrs. Cohoon shows no signs of the complexes which
	I am sure would harrass me if I were in her shoes. She even encourages
	her husband to give prizes, such as trips to Florida, for the homemakers
	who send in the best hints. All I can say is she must be a paragon
	among women, and she must run the most efficient household in the
	world. While chatting with homemaking expert Cohoon over lunch in
	New York the other day, I learned that he now has a roster of more
	than a half million women who have sent in their most prized household
	hints for his consideration. "They come in at the rate of about 20,000
	a month," said Cohoon. "We invite women to send in these hints over
	various radio and television programs, in newspapers and magazines
	and on the labels of the products. "It's amazing how many bright
	ideas for short cuts and thrift arrive by every mail. And what surprises
	me is how many brand new ideas keep coming in. You'd think after
	a while they'd already have thought of everything. But there are
	fewer repetitions than you would think possible." Cohoon and his
	cohorts will take 40 winning homemakers and their husbands for a
	week's free vacation in Elliuor Village, Fla. in June. "My wife thinks
	it's only fair” says he, "that housewives be rewarded for their
	bright ideas, just as employes in other businesses get rewards for
	bright suggestions. When I first brought up this idea to Mrs. Cohoon,
	she was delighted. In fact, she produced a few household hints of
	her own that nobody else had thought of." I guess, when you have
	to compete with a half million expert homemakers. you simply have
	to top them. And that, perhaps, is Mrs. Cohoon's secret.},

  abstract = {Through explication of a visual research method, this paper theorizes
	how masculine identity interacts with consumption-of imagery, products,
	desires, and passions in advertising and consumer culture. We analyze
	the male body as a discursive "effect" created at the intersection
	of consumption and several marketing discourses such as advertising,
	market segmentation, and visual communication, balancing between
	brand strategy-what the marketer intends-and brand community-the
	free appropriation of meaning by the market. The paper's contribution
	rests in extending previous work on male representation into historical,
	ontological, and photographic realms, providing a necessary complement
	between understanding advertising meaning as residing within managerial
	strategy or wholly subsumed by consumer response. We argue that greater
	awareness of the connections between the traditions and conventions
	of visual culture and their impact on the production and consumption
	of advertising images leads to enhanced ability to understand how
	advertising works as a representational system and signifying practice.

	process. It is currently illegal, under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971,
	section 9A, to supply acidifiers and other paraphernalia to injectors
	in the UK. In the current climate of evidence-based practice, any
	consideration given to changing the law would look for evidence to
	illustrate that the paraphernalia was necessary. Although the theory
	behind the use of acidifiers suggests they are essential, no previous
	work using street heroin has actually been reported to illustrate
	this fact. Anecdotal information has found that drug users are being
	told by some service providers that the addition of acids is unnecessary.
	It is important that drugs services give credible information to
	their clients. The provision of inaccurate information in one area
	may lead to a lack of trust of all information provided. The small

	the effects of citric and ascorbic acids (vitamin C) on injections

	forms of heroin (in the form of the salt or the base) and the impact

	hundred and four opiate addicts in London were interviewed about
	the forms of heroin (white, brown, etc) and their relationship to
	cook-up techniques (use of heat and acid). White heroin was typically
	prepared with water and heat; brown heroin was prepared with acid
	(citric acid or Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) or lemon juice) and heat;
	pharmaceutical heroin was prepared with water only (i.e. neither
	acid nor heat). On the last occasion of heroin use, brown heroin
	had been the form most commonly used, with over 90% of the sample
	using citric acid or vitamin C. Lemon juice was rarely used, and
	heat was almost universally applied in conjunction with lemon juice.
