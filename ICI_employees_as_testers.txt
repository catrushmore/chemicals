Hi and thank you for posting this article! My grandfather worked at Welwyn and researched the occupational health aspects of working with vinyl chloride. He and my fathers family lived in the 'plastic house' for a while. I have some photos in my collection of the house and site but I am searching for more! If anyone has anything they wish to share please feel free to email me: steuart.stafford@btinternet.com. Many thanks

My father, John Harvey, worked for the company from 1941 until his death in 1973,my sister & I still have photo's of his taken of Broadwater Rd & "The new site" upto the mid 60's. He worked in the Technical & Reseach dep. upto the early 60's, then in Sales & Development.**I remember at home, in Howlands WGC, having all the trail products we had to use, New Vymura wallpaper, we were as kids of 8 allowed to draw, paint bash this new product, just to see to my father & ICI if it was "kid proof" I thought everyone had new telly's, phones, kettles, & everything you need for the home made out of plastic. Some worked & are now "the norm", others were a disaster & are still metal etc.** In 1966 he was part of the ICI team that went to Peking with the British Government Trade Exhibition, the first in China, and was introduced to Chairman Moa, the ICI team sold the Chinese a copy of "The New Billingham" plastic's plant which I believe was built in Shanghi, but upset The USSR. Father & The ICI team then went to Moscow, meeting President Kosegin, and selling them the same style plant, this was built on the East German/Polish boarder, and because of the staff of the plant not caring or knowing about its operation, is now one of the most polluted places on the planet. Happy Child hood memories Thank You ICI Staff & company

I also remember an ICI house being on the site and I used to act as a photographic model and have photos of me hanging out washing on a washing line and another unloading shopping within the ICI house kitchen.
