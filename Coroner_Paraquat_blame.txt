"grief-stricken father Mr James Parsons told the inquest that he blamed his own stupidity for the tragedy. 
His children he said were in the habit of looking in his workbag beause they knew that they could often find 'sweets and other nice things' in it. Mr Parsons a fitter ..... told coroner Dr A Gordon Daviews how he took the weed killer home from work. "Through my own stupidity I put it in a coke bottle - I just didn't give it a throught"  The cororner said "As in all these sad cases the story is the same. People see this weedkiller working well at their works and they decide to take some home, usually in an unlabelled bottle. When are the public going to learn? They must be told that if they are going to do this, they must mark the botttles. I don't know if the public realise, but no-one to my knowledge has ever surviced after drinking this weed killer. They must be warned' "
