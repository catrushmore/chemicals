[Contextual] Weeding has typically been described in advertisements as time consuming, dull, back breaking work that spoils leisurely or creatively enjoying the garden, even if some gardeners confess to finding weeding meditative or a productive way of spending time in the garden. For those who would rather speed up the task or make it more comfortable, a market has developed for mechanical and chemical aids to this chore. Quite often in these adverts and articles, war is invoked and a battle scene between the gardener and the weed, or the weed and the gardener's choice of plants, is set out. 

Paraquat, and the closely related chemical diquat, were developed from 1953 by researchers at Plant Protection Limited, which was a subsidiary of Imperial Chemical Industries. Screening tests showed that they were very effective nonselective herbicides. Paraquat and diquat were rapidly inactivated by clay particles in soil.  William Boon, an ICI biochemist convinced his reluctant colleagues that even though this was not how most of the weedkillers currently on the market worked, these could be useful properties in a herbicide. In paraquat's properties Boon saw the potential for, and then developed, not just a herbicide, but a revolutionary new system of arable farming. The aim of this herbicide was to do away with ploughing vegetation into the ground, meaning that moisture would be retained, as well as make land that was hard to plough potentially usable and also avoid soil erosion.  ICI promised that paraquat would boost the nation's total area of productive land, and when exported overseas was set to guarantee riches to the UK's chemical industry. In post-war Britain which was rebuilding its economy, these were powerful motivators to develop a new product. 

ICI's "chemical plough" was introduced to the agricultural and horticultural market in 1962, under the brand name Gramoxone, which had a concentration of active ingredient paraquat at 20%. Gramoxone arrived with farmers as a brown liquid and among the warnings about avoiding contact with skin and eyes, there were instructions that, it should not be decanted from the original containers. 

Gramoxone was never intended for home use and Plant Protection developed a less concentrated paraquat-based weedkiller called Weedol for domestic or amateur gardeners, which they marketed widely from 1965. [**show 1966 advert**] The active ingredient was only 5% instead of 20%.  It was sold as packets of granules or pellets, where the whole 2 ounce packet was to be dissolved directly in a 2 gallon watering can. This reduced the need for the user to measure out and handle the product, as well as there being no left over granules or solution to store.  

Perhaps inevitably, Gramoxone was decanted into drinks bottles by people whose job it was to clear unwanted vegetation - agricultural workers, council workers, people maintaining runways and railways - and from 1966 accidents started to happen.  These familiarly shaped bottles found their way into bags, glove compartments, sheds, kitchens and even fridges where they were mistaken for dark coloured drinks: cola, Ribena, stout then swigged by curious or thirsty children, teens and adults, with very serious and sad consequences for there was no known antidote to paraquat poisoning. Plants required sunlight to trigger photosynthesis which acted on the chemical leading to death, but when drunk, paraquat could be quickly absorbed into the blood even if it was spat out.  The chemical has a peculiar effect on lung tissue in particular, causing cell proliferation in the lungs which then effectively solidify. This was a horrifyingly certain and slow death, despite doctors' best efforts to deactivate or dilute the chemical in the bloodstream. When Plant Protection were trying to get clearance from the Advisory Committee on Poisonous Substances Used in Agriculture and Food Storage in 1962, they presented results from acute and chronic LD50 tests on rats, rabbits and a small sample of hens. Disruption of finger nail growth and nosebleeds in staff packing the chemical had also been observed, explained away by improving the use of gloves and better ventilation. A variety of possible actions were discussed by the scientists on the committee and Plant Protection representatives, but why animals died and why ICI workers had been affected in that way was not known. The benefits of the chemical seemed to outweigh the potential problems, problems that could be avoided if sensible precautions were taken.   

However, it wasn't just the users who failed to adhere to the condition of sale that Gramoxone was not to be decanted, as in 1968 a case reported in a Cambridge newspaper told of a store that sold Gramoxone in a reused lemonade bottle, delivering it to the purchasers' doorstep.  Luckily no-one was poisoned, but the chemist was found guilty of gross carelessness and fined.  In 1967 Plant Protection sent what they called a "strongly worded letter" to its main agents and distributors reminding them about the dangers of selling Gramoxone that was not in its original container.

Plant Protection were resistant to suggestions that the word "Poison" should be included on the label, preferring the alternative wording "Not to be taken" and "Harmful if taken" or "Dangerous if swallowed" which are really not as hard hitting. They maintained that when users followed the instructions, the product was safe. Plant Protection compiled details of incidents and compared their frequency to the amount of Gramoxone used annually showing perhaps one accidental death and one suicide each year from 1966. They blamed the relatively high number of deaths in Ireland when considered in relation to the amount of Gramoxone used, on small scale users of agricultural chemical and the custom of taking any container to get filled with whatever substance, and this practice did not take place England, Wales and Scotland. 

Despite fatal accidents occurring since 1966, the Daily Mail did not report on any until 1968. Before that date, stories about paraquat were limited to the farming column and the gardening column which only proclaimed the benefits of the herbicide. The front page news of Britain's first lung transplant in 1968 is also one of a 15 year old Alex Smith's accidental paraquat poisoning. The Mail did not name the herbicide, but  it is clearly gramoxone from the descriptions "looked like Coca Cola" and the effect on the lungs in particular [13.05.68 Boy and Girl in lung-swop operation,18.05.68 Lung boy sits up for icecream, 29.05.68 Lung transplant boy dies All The Daily Mail, p1 ]. That same year, the paper's farming column reported that the Essex branch National Farmers Union wanted the danger of the product to be emphasised on the label. This was the first time the Mail explicitly associated paraquat with fatal poisonings [Peter Bullen, Weedkiller Warning, p4 25.05.68].  A couple of months after this story, the paper reported on the death of a child who drank paraquat from a lemonade bottle - this story appeared in the general news [cannot find article? check the Kew photos]. Another article in the Farming column later that same year announced that liquid formulations of paraquat were going on the Home Office poisons list, but that Weedol was exempt [Killer chemical goes on Poisons List, Peter Bullen, 09.09.68 p6] 

There was a big rise in paraquat poisoning stories from 1971 and I speculated that the trigger for the Daily Mail to start reporting on deaths was not necessarily that they were becoming more frequent, but that they were no longer just affecting adult workers. This could not be the case, because we've seen accidental weedkiller (which is plainly gramoxone) deaths of children and teens being reported.  Perhaps it was to do with a lack of clarity about regulations on sales, the presence of Weedol on the market and potential for domestic users to seek out paraquat and equate stronger with better, or just pure horror at how a chemical that could lead to such an agonising death could be so widely available. I need to do further research is needed to find out what this tipping point or change at the Daily Mail was. 

Accidental poisonings as news items meant that paraquat left the confines of niche gardening and farming columns. These stories invariably conveyed the lack of effective treatment available, often with the stock phrase "no known antidote".  It was the chemical paraquat, rather than the brand name Gramoxone, that was held accountable. Each of these accidental poisonings could be attributed to the agricultural herbicide being taken from a workplace, some have said stolen, then stored and labelled inappropriately in a domestic environment.  

In 1972, marking ten years of paraquat on the market and six years since the first fatality, the Daily Mail took up the cause of accidental paraquat poisoning, focusing on the risk to children.  The newspaper ran their own investigation into how easy it was to obtain Gramoxone and that controls on its retail were not working. Simultaneously, adverts in the Daily Mail for Weedol disappeared in 1972 and apart from one advert I found in 1975, did not appear again regularly until 1978, 6 years of turning down revenue. ICI placed an advert entitled "Ideas in Action from ICI" in 1974 which showcased some of their revolutionary products, with Gramoxone being first on the list, followed by anaesthetic and fire fighting compound. Changes for the better, world wide. In this advert, ICI spelled out how much money the company was investing and making in the UK, an interesting to show the company company in a positive light when the country was in recession. This advert appeared one day before the Mail launched into nearly two weeks of daily reports of a murder involving paraquat.

The Daily Mail newspaper's active role in educating readers about the dangers of paraquat can also be seen in the MAFF files, in the form of requests for information from their reporters. The files also show civil servants' reactions to articles from the Daily Mail and it shows them learning to anticipate what journalists would be asking for. There was a mixture of relief that the paper was getting across information about storing chemicals safely and following instructions for safe use, but also irritation that the journalists were misreporting and mangling other facts, even that they were appeared to be getting their information from sources other than MAFF. 

Extensive reporting of accidental poisoning was educational because people became more aware of *why* they shouldn't decant industrial strength herbicide into unlabelled bottles, and what the consequences could be of asking a friend for a bit of the amazing weedkiller from their work. 

Perhaps another consequence of reporting fatalities from the chemical was that deliberate poisonings started to occur. In  1973 Dr Matthews of the Poisons Board blamed what he called "disproportionate" media coverage given to paraquat deaths for the fact that in Scotland, the number of accidental deaths from paraquat was overshadowed by the number of suicides with the chemical. Weedol featured in numerous para-suicides; the reports in medical journals of this uses of the domestic chemical do not state whether the user knowingly chose this weaker form as a signal of distress, or because they were unaware that the paraquat reported on in most news stories was actually the more potent form Gramoxone.

Murderous paraquat users were portrayed  in the newspapers as adulterous, jealous men and women, in turbulent or unconventional relationships, who administered the weedkiller in sherry, in cups of tea or mixed into stews. These murders were described in salacious detail in the newspaper. In one case, a woman who poisoned her husband even stated that she had got the idea from a story in the newspaper. On this subject, newspapers remained quiet, despite the interesting question of their responsibility for copy-cat behaviour triggering. 

There was no blame or demonisation from the journalists towards those who brought the potent chemical home and accidentally poisoned a  family member. However, they didn't mince words when they could be delivered from authority figures. William Boon, father of paraquat, was reported as attributing accidental deaths to "human stupidity". As poisonings of this type accumulated, a coroner was reported as frustratedly saying "when will these people learn?", but the reporters at the paper did not expand or moralise on the subject of who "these people" were.

This project is supposed to be about the users of chemicals, So, who were these people? 
MAFF described people who brought home Gramoxone from agricultural or horticultural stocks as trying to avoid the expense of buying Weedol. From the circumstances reported in newspapers, liquid paraquat preparations tended to be brought home by quite young men, who worked in agricultural or horticultural jobs or were in social circles with people who did and could therefore access the high concentration product. One of the accidents occurred in a static caravan park, not generally known for the wealth of their inhabitants. 

This profile does not match the image of users shown in the advertisements for Weedol **[show adverts]**, which is a middle aged male, he has a little belly, this is his garden, he's using it among flowers and shrubs - not to clear expanses of weeds, and he's at leisure - he's wearing a casual jumper, smoking a pipe. 

Standing up to weeds is perhaps not war like, but it is sending dual message - that you don't have to be beaten by weeds and you don't have to be on your knees, you can stand up to weed... Again, it's the man doing this task. Are women less inclined to use weedkillers? Are women supposed to be nurturing rather than killing? Maybe that'll come through in oral history work or more archival research. 

We can see from these verbose, very informative if you take the time to read them -adverts that great pains were taken to put across the ease and simplicity of use, using the plants natural processes to kill the plant. There is no mention of the percentage of active ingredient. The product is not related in any way to gramoxone by these adverts, but equally no attempt is made to distinguish it from it. In a way, ICI needed the success of the agricultural chemical to get domestic users to seek out paraquat based products.  We can just about see some  of the precautions, and restrictions - here is says only use as a garden weedkiller. 

Wrapping Up

I have shown that Paraquat had been enthusiastically received in niche newspaper columns. We have also seen that an agricultural paraquat product, Gramoxone, never intended by the manufacturers for domestic use *was* invited into some private homes and gardens, resulting in fatal poisoning. Deaths relating to paraquat were recorded from 1966, a year after Weedol was widely marketed to home gardeners.  The Daily Mail promoted the benefits of paraquat products and advertised Weedol. Unintended uses of paraquat based herbicides brought the chemical to wider attention and media reports of these unintended uses contributed to these uses being perpetuated. 

I thought it was interesting where poisonings were reported in the newspaper the chemical name, paraquat, was generally held accountable, rather than the brand names of the paraquat products. A critical point was reached in 1971, possibly the total number of fatalities, where that newspaper seemed to take up an educational role communicating the full dangers of paraquat to potential users and even existing users.  This was possibly because ICI preferred to focus only on the adherence to their instructions for safe use and not give details of the consequences of not following their precautions.   

While the Daily Mail was running a lot of stories about paraquat related deaths, they stopped advertising Weedol which had been seen regularly in the paper from 1966 until 1970. In Weedol adverts that depicted a user, this imagined user  did not match the image of those who chose to bring the stronger version home. 

Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your comments and questions.
