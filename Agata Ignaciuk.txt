looking at advertisements for the pill in Spanish medical magazines 
contraception was a "crime against life" according to Franco, so sales, advertising and use of contraception was illegal under Franco. When he died, the topic was able to be opened up and openly spoken against.

Companies wanted to sell this drug; being prescribed for long periods of time to healthy women as well as gynaecologically troubled ones would be very profitable.

Doctors prescribed the pill, but as a therapeutic treatment for menstrual disorders, or regulation, with a side effect of contraception. I liked the idea that a women who had just given birth would need therapeutic contraception, as a rest. 
In addition to some people going to the doctor with these things to be treated, these could be complaints that women could use/describe in order to be prescribed the pill. 
Another aspect is that some women would not have known that the medication they were on to treat a condition, would have had this effect. 

The aspect on advertising was interesting, as it definitely touched on some of the things I have been trying to articulate in relation to weedkillers. I haven't seen any conceptual ideas of weeds (e.g. 4 rows of 7, concept of idealised 28day cycle), but I have seen lots of images of weeds (e.g. images of calendars) also views of packets. Agata said that the images of users became more dominant when the market was saturated and doctors had to be helped to see more of their patients as potential pill-takers. In adverts for weedkiller, there is not any diversity shown in user, and there is always a strong emphasis on the variety of scenarios that it can be used in. Perhaps the difference here is that the user purchases directly, where as in the contraceptive case, the doctor is the one who holds most power.
