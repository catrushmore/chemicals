Title	Fergusson
Description	This collection is made up of Ursula Fergusson's personal diaries between 1967 - 1977. 

The collection lacks biographical context but as the diaries were purposely written as an insight into an ordinary person's life, in a language infused with keen observations and strong opinions, these records are very interesting to read. 

Written on loose lined sheets, the diaries are easy to access with neat handwriting and at the beginning, an index of persons referred to in the text. The entries themselves concern her domestic chores, her poodle Misty, her friends and family and her gardening interest. The text is full of remarks of the kind 'Pat's frock, a cotton one patterned with screaming pink, yellow and red flowers, was awful - she has no dress sense!' but also more generous reflections over people, revealing a (presumable) older woman's honest thoughts. The diaries also cover important events, such as her husband's death. 

Keywords: Diaries, Domestic life, Family, 1960s, 1970s. 

This collection was donated by Miss R. Fergusson in May 1991.

Title	Swales
Description	This collection compromises the personal diaries of Mrs. Mary Swales, from 1970 - 1986. 

Mary Swales, nee Duggan, was born in London in c. 1905. She went to Bostall Lane School, Woolwich, where she met her future husband as well as many lifelong friends. After school she went into "service", being domestic work. According to her friend recollections of Mrs. Swales stories, it seems she served in a very grand household. There was apparently stories of keeping the fire burning to warm the master's dog who was with puppies. 

She married Mr. Swales around 1939, at which point she stopped working. He was an engineer at Tate & Lyle, had a motorbike and was 'a "homebody" like her.' They had their house and garden meticulously kept and decided not to have children. Instead they went on holidays together and she read a lot and wrote frequent letters. Since her twenties, she had been profoundly deaf but got along with hearing aids and the ability to read in the lips. 

Her husband died in 1979, and from then on she stayed indoors a lot. She continued to work hard at keeping herself and her home perfect, she wore boned corsets till the end and her pyjama was always well ironed. She decided to die on the same date as her husband had died and was thoroughly annoyed when waking up alive! 

The diaries record her everyday activities, her shopping and her gardening up until she was admitted to hospital in late 1986. They give a vivid insight into the life of an old woman living by herself, relying on letters from friends and family, and friendly visits from neighbours. Although her life seems filled of monotony, she does not complain but often writes 'sat in chair'. 

Keywords: Diaries, Gardening, Domestic life, 1970s, 1980s, Travel.

Title	Tyzack-Kirkwood
Description	John Tyzack Kirkwood was born in April 1877. During the beginning of the 1940s, being in his mid 60s, he lived in Woking, Surrey. 

This collection is made up of his diaries written between 1940 - 1943. The diaries give precise meteorological descriptions, details of work done on his allotment or smallholding and other domestic details. There are also daily notations of air raids and bombings of London and surrounding areas. 

The entries mix personal activities with the matter-of-fact like observations from the war, quite astonishing to someone who has not experienced the same thing. For example, on the 12th of September 1940 he writes: '20 bombs were dropped in neighbourhood by raiders chased by our fighters from Luton. No damage at W. two causalities. Odd jobs in garden after tea. Germans continue indiscriminate bombings of London'. 

The diaries are handwritten in large format desk diaries.

Keywords: Diaries, 1940 - 1945, World War II, Gardening, Woking, Air raids.
