In table 2, we saw that this advertised price of Weedol remained remarkably stable over time, which reflected the need to recoup the costs of development and manufacturing, but may have frustrated some would-be users.1 

Early on in Weedol's provisional commercial clearance the PSPS expert groups had identified the high cost of Weedol had been identified as a potential push factor for some users towards the cheaper Gramoxone, and the likelihood that it would be stored inappropriately.2

Trials conducted by New Zealand farmers compared sodium and calcium chlorate, finding them to be equally effective.1 It is unclear why sodium chlorate emerged as the winner in these trials when both chemicals had approximately similar herbicidal results.

A&W's position as the main sodium chlorate manufacturer in the early 1930s suggest that when those first allotment holders struggled to find it, and the NAS dealt direct with importers on their behalf, it was possibly A&W's chemical that they were handling. Despite this, A&W do not seem to have entered the domestic consumer market, as advertisements for sodium chlorate weedkiller can not be traced to this company. 

Online there cannot be face to face reiteration of appropriate use, although the equivalent of recording purchasers' addresses is left in the form of the digital trail left by most internet shoppers and the same shoppers could look up all the relevant (and irrelevant) information about the hazards of such chemicals and their safe use. By leaving product reviews domestic users openly admit to buying industrial strength concentrates without understanding how to use them properly, while others share information about their practices including pointers for safe use and their rationale for buying such products. Retailers do not appear to face action for selling professional products to inappropriate domestic users. This will be a rich resource and area of study for future researchers.
