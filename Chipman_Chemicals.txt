Title: Weed killing train, 1955

Date: 1955-04-05

Place: London, England

Description: Worker spraying railway track with weed killer, 5 April 1955. Weeds growing in ballast between the tracks can undermine the rails and can also cause trains to lose adhesion and slip. Weedkilling trains like this one, with herbicides provided by the Chipman Chemical Company Ltd, were therefore used to spray vegetation.
