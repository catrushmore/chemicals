equipment for cleaning is one of the elastic items in a budget
a lambeth mother would like to spend 5d on soap, 1d on soda, 1d on blue and starch. she must compress the expenditure to 3d or 5d, sometimes 2d has to do. There is the remains of  abloom. Bucket and cloth, hopelessly work out shirt or pinafore. 
One woman heard of a soda which could be bought in the Walk for less than the traditional 7 pounds for 3 d, and in her great economy, supplied her house with this inferior kind. She scrubbed and washed and cleaned with it until her arms lost all their skin and she was takne into the workhouse infirmary with dangerous blood poisoning.

two pennyworth of soap may have to wash the clothes scrub the floors and wash the people eo f a family for a week. It is difficult to realise the soap famine in such a household. Soda being cheap is made to do a great deal. sometimes appears in the children's weekly bath, often washes their hair. Using one piece of soap t scrub the floor next brought it into tplay when she bathed the baby, with a scratch on the baby from a cinder in the soap. visitor suggested cutting piece into 2, instead of buying 2 pieces, but was told it wouldn't last as long.
