**A review of the History of Advertising Trust Archive (Raveningham, Norfolk, United Kingdom) .**

In March 2013, I  spent a couple of days looking at books and marketing material for chemical products used by people at home. I was interested in the archives that History of Advertising Trust holds relating to Thawpit, a dry cleaning chemical, and for some Reckitts products. I wanted to write this review because whenever I’ve mentioned the HAT to other researchers, they haven’t heard of it. I think that more people should know about it, because the collections are a lot richer than just adverts. 

When I planned my visit, I browsed the website to get a rough idea of the collections that might be of interest. The online search facility is likely to be available in late 2013. The collections knowledge and expertise of the archivists is hugely valuable. I explained the areas I was interested in and the archivists suggested what might be useful to me. They are in the best position to advise on whether the amount of material you think you can look at in a day is feasible, because the files are quite diverse. In this way, we arranged everything two weeks in advance of my visit. Prearranging a visit is essential because the Research and Study Centre is small; I spread out accross couple of tables and a volunteer was repacking material on the remaining tables. 

Visiting HAT is quite a different experience from visiting a city centre based archive, though the rural trip is a pleasant change for anyone usually based in busy urban places.   HAT is located at the Raveningham Centre, which is a cluster of craft and antiques businesses, so there are small brown tourist signs on the roads nearby. All the travel details are well described on the HAT website. HAT occupies the furthest building on the complex and there is plenty of parking for cars and bikes. I’m in the fortunate position that my family lives nearby, but there are B&Bs and holiday cottages in the surrounding villages and small towns. 

Upon arriving, researchers sign a visitor book. A simple paper form is completed so that the archive can collect basic information about you, your academic or company affiliation and your area of research. The archive is a single storey building with ramped access and there is an accessible toilet. The general atmosphere is quietly industrious, informal and welcoming to researchers. 

The archive has lockers for personal belongings and there are plenty of spare pencils provided in the search room should anyone discover that their usual stock of pencils is mysteriously absent from their bag. There are plugs and extension leads for plugging in laptops and there is Wi-Fi (ask for the password) is available if you would like to use it. 

The Research and Study Centre is open plan, with the archivists’ desks at one end of the room, and space for researchers at four tables in the library.  Enquiries are recieved through the day, so if you are distracted by the low level noise of a working office, take some headphones. When I was there an athlete wanted to find out who had directed an advert he’d appeared in, and a journalist was sourcing a video clip for their online content, so it was interesting to occasionally eavesdrop. 

There is a self service photocopier (colour or black and white) or a HAT camera if the item is not suitable for the photocopier. Personal cameras or scanners are not allowed. As this is a self service arrangement, you need to keep track of archival codes for referencing or revisiting. My photocopies were counted at the end of the session, after which I paid. If you’re going to be using reproductions in publications, the process is more involved. I found the system adequate for my research purposes, and the charge of 20p per A4 sheet (B&W) was reasonable. All their charges are explained on the website.

At staff break times, I was invited for a cup of coffee in the small break room. It was pleasant to sit and chat with the archivists and volunteers. Researchers can bring a packed lunch and this is a good place to eat it. One of the other busienesses at the Raveningham Centre is a cafe where you can buy refreshments, light lunches and cakes. 

As many of the deposits are made by advertising agencies, researchers have access to not just the final adverts and details of where and when they were published or broadcast, but also correspondance and research associated with the advertising account. This means that researchers can access market research data, information on the state of the market and retailing, and even track how certain decisions have been made about  product positioning. It all depends on the agency’s filing system so this won’t apply to all accounts, but it is worth approaching with an open mind.  
 
Fundamentally, an advertising agency has to understand their target market and to be able to portray users of technologies or services that people can identify with. However, I hadn’t expected to find market research that yeilded such detailed answers to questions I’d hoped might be touched upon. I was able to see what chemicals people were using in preference to the product in question and their reasons why. I felt like it was giving me the little window into the decisions about everyday life that I was wanted, and that I had worried maybe I couldn’t get in quite the same detail or volume through reading Mass Observation diaries and exercises, or from oral histories collected now. I was amused by the failed quest for a limescale encrusted toilet for photographing before and after treatment with a new toilet cleaner. I could see legislation for safety warnings come into effect, the letters that discussed their necessity and how to incorporate them into the design. All this handily gathered in one place felt like a treasure trove for me. I hope it can be useful, and enjoyable, for other researchers too.
