Cerebos (p39-40)
enriched table salt - magnesium carbonate and calcium phospate with household salt. Much more free-running than coarse blocks which had to be crushed. Samples sent out to doctors who rased public awareness. 
Also sold baking poweder and own brand of health salts - Seraph

 Advert in Vogue1953- “right away! describes the way Cerebos Salt pours from its hygenic container. No matter how damp the atmosphere the pure white crystals come pouring out at the first tile. Nno clogging, no lumps no waste. This is why housewives insist that it is actually a wise economy to pay a little more for Cerebos. Saves in the long run.”  (p40)
