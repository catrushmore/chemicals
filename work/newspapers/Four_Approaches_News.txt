social sicnetists - journalst constuct news, make news, socially construct reality. News is the result of the methods newsowrkers employ. (Fishman 1980) News is manufactured by journalists (Cohen and Young 1973)

"journalists make the news just as carpenters make houses and sicnetists make science"

News and news programmes could almost be called random reactions to random events" Jounralists confront the unexpected, the dramatic, the unprecedented, even the bizarre. Event driven news calls for social scientists to alter preocupation with institution driven news.

How much of the news stories I've been looking at have been institution driven news?
	poisonings - very much individual stories, institutions involved or who make statements would be CPS, police, (though not to the paper, journalists would just be in court) companies, hospitals, but these are not stories delivered to the press by institutions press agencies.  There were some press releases to do with the changing of regulations, but not about specific situations. 
Do I agree with random reactions to random events?
	Journalists dealing non randomly, applying formulaic treatments and phrases to categorise, order and explain. With paraquat and the DM they quickly sought, identified and reported patterns, they did not treat these as random events.
