Oral History Interviews

Aim - to get a more detailed story of user experiences 

Select - through contacts made during research 
and through people who completed a questionnaire and have agreed that they can be contacted
  (distribution and return of questionnaire still in research)

Considering ethics 
* People could be or become concerned or worried about their exposure to chemicals over their normal lifetime activities, or their impact on others/ the environment. 
* People who want to take part in this may have some point to make from one stance or another
* Allow anonnymity or psuedonyms if requested
* These are not people connected with the chemicals in a business sense, they may want to say negative things about chemical companies, shops, people, organisations, whoever, and for whatever reason, so would rather not have identity disclosed. 
* Do not bombard with questions that make the interviewee feel ignorant, stupid or overwhelmed - ask the interviewer about their life experiences and their views on the world. 

Prepare an information pack with addresses to write to for expert information, numbers to call e.g. environment agency
Stop the interview if interviewee is getting too agitated, upset and off topic. Offer to restart when calmer, another time or to abandon the interview. 
Send a transcript of the interview with a thank you note. 

Considering safety 
* Publically diarise details of interview plans: location, date, time  
* Take charged mobile phone
* If other people wish to remain with the interviewee but not take part in the interview, this is fine so long as theyâ€™re quiet.
