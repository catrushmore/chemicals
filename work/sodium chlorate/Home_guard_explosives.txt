Homeguard

unconventional fighting techniques inc mixing own explosives - 
		would I be able to find these recipes, or at least what was in them?
		Interesting to know that there would have been this method of transmitting information too though. 
		
		
		A number of Pioneers also in their own time studied explosives and demolitions tinder the guidance of Officers of the Twelfth whose civilian occupation was connected with such subjects, and these Home Guard explosive experts assisted in a number of demolitions of buildings and stacks in the Birmingham Area.

		Home Guard Training Establishment[edit]
The grounds of Osterley Park were used for the training of the first members of the Local Defence Volunteers (forerunners of the Home Guard) when the 9th Earl, a friend of publisher Lord Hulton, allowed writer and military journalist Captain Tom Wintringham to establish the first Home Guard training school (which Hulton sponsored) at the park in May/June 1940, teaching the theory and practice of modern mechanical warfare, guerilla warfare techniques and using the estate workers' homes, then scheduled for demolition, to teach street fighting techniques.[3] The painter Roland Penrose taught camouflage techniques here,[4] attempting to disguise the obvious charms of a naked Lee Miller. Maj. Wilfred Vernon taught the art of mixing home-made explosives, and his explosives store can still be seen at the rear of the house, while Canadian Bert "Yank" Levy, who had served under Wintringham in the Spanish Civil War taught knife fighting and hand-to-hand combat. Despite winning world fame in newsreels and newspaper articles around the world (particularly in the US), the school was disapproved of by the War Office and Winston Churchill, and was taken over in September 1940. Closed in 1941, its staff and courses were reallocated to other newly opened WO-approved Home Guard schools.[3]
