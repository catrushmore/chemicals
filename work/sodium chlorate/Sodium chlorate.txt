If I use sodium chlorate weedkiller on my garden, is it likely to contaminate vegetables subsequently grown there?

although I use a lot fo chlorate of soda to kill weeds on paths and drives, I am reluctat to appl it to cultivated ground. It is uspposed to lose all its killing powers within a year of application but there is always the chance of some residue that may cause ill health in the crops that follow. I do not think that any vegetables grown up on the ground afterwards are in any way dangerous to eat. It is just a matter of whether they will grow well.
