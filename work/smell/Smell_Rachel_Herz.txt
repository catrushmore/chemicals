I know what I like Understanding odour preferences

A Smell Culture reader

The feel of a smell not often appreciated. Most smells have a feel. Methol feels cool, ammonia is burning. Percieved through the trigeminal nerve, runs throughout the face and nose. 
Almost all doors have a trigeminal component, varying from mild to intense
geraniol (sweet rose) is mild
benzyl acetate (synthetic pear-like) is moderate
acetone is strong
Intense = irritating, painful. 
vanilla and hydrogen sylfide do not stimulate the trigeminal system - these are rare cases. 
p194
elicitation of strong/irritating trigeminal response can explain why certain odours can be immediately disliked

p195
we are cued to whether we should like or dislike an door by what name it has, even before we wmell it. IF the denotation of an door stimulus is neutral , we may need more direct interaction with it for emotional impression to form.

role of culture in developing preferences
methyl salicyclate 0 wintergreen. 
UK study (Moncrieff 1966) this had one of the lowest ratings for pleasantness, but in the US (Cain and Johnson 1978) it had the highest. In UK = medicine, especially rub on alagesics polar during WW2.  The smell of wintergreen is almost exclusively the smell of candies. 

Similarly the smell of sarsaparilla is disliked in UK medicinal odour, but in US it is root beer and liked. 

US military tried to create stink bomb as crowd dispersal tool. Tested series of foul odours, including  a toilet smell, in countries around the world but failed to find any odour that was consistently evaluated as repelling. 

odours with strong trigeminal stimulation (e.g. ammonia) are often immediately repelling. Avoidance response.
