interviewed 511 females and 478 males in Chicago
most had grown up in the city or suburbs, but 45 states and 39 countries were represented
85% were susceptible to certain odours that triggered nostalgic feelings. True for happy and unhappy childhoods. had anticipated that unhappy childhood might preclude nostalgic feelings but this was not the case. People with unhappy childhoods were twice as likely to have an olfactory-evoked recall precipitated by an odour that most of us consider foul - BO, dog waste, mothballs, sewer gas and bus fumes. 

Born before 1930 - less urbanised and industrialised
born after 1930 - more likely to mention food and artificial odours. 
responses to same odours also change over time. e.g. born before 1930 - childhoods of fresh cut grass, those born between 1960 and 1979 associated the smell with an unpleasant necessity. History , lifestyle and changing technology affect perceptions.
