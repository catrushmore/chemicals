.... selection based on the whether the paper represented a scientific 
breakthrough, significantly enhanced defence capability or provided 
economic benefit for Australia. [which does Crone’s work fall into?]
... represent only a small fraction of the enormous 
output of DSTO and its heritage divisions. The available records 
show that since1986 DSTO has published about 6500 formal 
reports and at least as many conference and journal papers. From 
the 1950s to 1986 it is estimated that the defence science divisions 
produced a total of about 5000 reports.

Crone is an expert on health and safety and works for the Personnel Protectio Group at the MAterials Research Laboraties, Melbourn Australi. Sometimes, his professional knowledge interferes with the flow of the book, for example when he enters the speciaist world of equipment for the workplace. However most of the time he calmly imparts he information a lay person needs for a proper perspective on the threat from chemicals.  
Well times punchest at the distortions of the media, the cranks of the health food racket, the quacks of alternative medicine and the soliciters who are waiting to sue the chem ind given haf  chance. 
Anyone who wishes to debate the effect of chem on human health and the env should first read Crones ook. if they still feel that they have a point to make then at least we can tae them seriously. Any people who suspect they have uncovered a chemical insult to society and wish to fighta campaign against it should also arm theselves with his book, the better to ensure their sucess. 
Must accept some risks. If not, ignorance will have finally triumphed [if all regulations are tightened to the piont of preventing the development of novel products]. Sadly the demand for nothing less than zero risk is gainaing ground. This is the mentality behind the popularity of natural foods and birbres, herbal remedies and alternative health treatments. If you live by the cosy belief that if nature produces it, then it must be safe, please read this book. Then enrol on a chemistry course - you’ll be surprised how enlightening and liberating the alt theray we can offer can be!.

This is typical of NS writing I think - people who don’t feel reasonalby literate or want to inform themselves of current goings on in the sciences wil not be reading this review, and those reading it will probably already have most of these opinions. Not everyone wants to be a scientist. Why on earth give the advice to enrol on a chemistry course? Really off putting and patronising. 

Review in Christian Science Monitor
Allan Smith, May 24 1988
http://www.csmonitor.com/1988/0524/dbchem.html

picks out Alice Ottoboni’s book “The dose makes the poison”
“In a chapter with the intriguing title ``Religion, Food, and Chemicals,'' the author plays the detached observer of society but **reveals his own biases. In less than a page he notes that religion appears to satisfy a basic human need for reassurance and for ceremony in all societies. He does not mention the role of religion in developing the human values by which the use of chemicals is judged**. He then takes on the health food trend, presenting compelling evidence for the irrational nature of most of the nutrition cults.
Other chapters are on chemical warfare, protection against chemicals, and **how the public can find out about chemicals**. One of his sobering conclusions is that we are seeing a **departure from rationalism** in a number of major aspects of the Chemical Age. But his **call for objectivity and wisdom** in working through these complex issues is welcome. ``Chemicals and Society'' is an engaging book, **required reading for anyone concerned about the impact of technology, particularly those shaping public policy.**”

I suspect that outside of specific circles, this book did not actually make much impact in the UK. Am asking about borrowing data from the 1980s from the PLR, but I suspect that the information I am after will not be forthcoming. 

I really do not like this book. It would be really difficult and intimidating for a total layperson to read. The personal comments are irrelevant, irritating and do not take into account / are alienating to people who for instance might choose to eat or prefer to eat meat processed with nitrite because it is cheaper, not that it is bland and insipid. Sausages? Bacon? not necessarily reformed and processed meat contains nitirite.

w regard to alternative medieices at least they are separated from herbal meds, but I disagree that they are not dangerous practices - they are dangerous if there is not another line of attack, ie it becomes neglect when there are conventional alternatives that would treat the condition sucessfully. 

Disses megadose vitamin tmt which Linus Pauling won the same Phi Beta Kappa award for

household chemicals have not been discussed in detail - just the occasional mention or inclusion in a table. 
commercial herbicides and insecticides are discussed more often, especially with an impatience that people are more worried about these which won’t be ingested than they are about taking megadoses of vitamins. 

p152 “domestic handling of chemicals is another problem which i shall deal with later”/// “domestic situation, in which least protectuve gear is available and in which least insturction can be given in safety matters. I will discuss the fixed installation, collective protection [lab, factory, industrial workers] first then the individual protectiona and lastly the home situation.

fume cupboards, respirators from military grade to disposable halfmask for dusts, household and garden
impatience with peoples lack of understanding demonstrated “ Respirators are prehaps the type of eqpt from which the inexperience person expects the most and uderstands the least. 1st point not understood is that one type of respirator will not protect against all risks. PArticulate filter will protect against asbestos fibre but not aains insecticide vapor. An absorbing filter that will protect agains insecticide vapor will not protect against hydrogen cyanide becase the charcoal in the filter is not a good absorbent for the small cyanide molecule. However, people go to a supplier adn say they want a respirator. It is v difficult to extract form them any information on what they want protection against. The beief is almost universal that one respirator, any respirator will rotect against any risk.” goes on to talk about proper fitting, inc beards and sideburns industrial managemetn, maintenance of kit.
MAterial choices - eg rubber glvoes can soakk up organic liquides and hold it against the skin - bare skin and frequent washing better. 

p165
management responsibility - if happy to hire and fire an ever changing population of employees, it probably doesn’t givea  damn about protecting them. Conversely if the employer wants to build up a stable group of workers then it is in his or her interest to protect them, for any compensation claims will come right back to the known emploer. 

domestic situation - unreal for chem manufactureers to expect the householder to have available any protection other than household rubber gloves, and overalls and aprons. Therefore chemicals for sale on the domestic market should be capable of being handled safetly by someone wearing the basic equipment. This would then particularly limit the domesetic use of toxic substances which are iether volatile or used as aerosols. However, from another point of view I recommend that further quipts is available at hoe, principally eye goggles and disposable half mask to protect agains dust particles and coarse aerosols. Certainly sensible protection which can be quit e cheap and readily obtained would help to reduct the incidence of poisoning in the house garden and fam. The most blatent example of lack of care that I recall was that of the man who sprayed the inside of his glass house with insecticide in hot weather when dressed only in shorts. He went to hospital but I cannot remember if he died. 


jist of next paragraph - in order to comment on industrial accidents etc you should have an understanding of PPE and practices even if you will never personally use them. 

[1 paragraph on domestic situation vs 12 pages of industrial/military/institutional use and protection]
Just what exactly does he expect people in househodls to be doing? Which dusts  and aeroslos are they encountering during which practices? What a stupid anecdote - why not say that he should have waited for a cooler day and worn protective kit? Or look up whether he died? Why not look up some other incidents, rather than ones you partially remember?

Introduces asbestos as a chemical that is mined then used without chemical modification. Discusses asbestos induced disease. “In the mind of the public, this is th emost worrying and unsettling fact - have I already been exposed to a chemical that will ill me in 10 years time?” Yes does not deal with likely exposure through products that contain asbestos that are probably quite stable - no reassurance, or discussion of this at all. Only discussion in context of industrial processes. 

Rest of chapter on agent orange - how bothered were peope actually about this? 
“no one can hold a meaningful opinion unless they have digested the facts.” p176

Vietnam veterans - what does this mean? Does it mean people who were under attck, or does it mean the people who sprayed and cleaned up? 

p177
“We survey the chemical world with a feelign of bewilderment. What the media and the public see as a great chemical evil is reported by scientists as being a useful cheical which has been used on a large scale for many years without causign any health problems at all. we are right to be bewildered. Are the media the tools of pressure grous that wish to distrot facts for some devious reason and is the public a hysteical body aof alarmist not intersted in facts? Or are the scientists and governemt officails in man countires consistently poducing fallacious information in suppor of the chemical industries? We wll try and answer som of these queries in the next chapter.”

p181
Once criticism has been made of a chemical, it is extremely diffiuclt to allay the fears of the public. This is largely because the public does not understnad scientific issues; it does not understnad the dose-response relationship, nor the difference between 10ppm and 0.1ppm of dioxin in 245 T. The organisation that inform the public ver often do not understand the ussues either. The mieda in general do not have journalists witha deep sicenfitic background and governmental public relations men are oftne passing on information that they themselves do not fully comprehend. 
The newspapers and television liek issues that are sensationand alarm the public. They liek elaborating on possiblye dangers wherease a reasonsed argument that puts matters in perspetive is not seen as appealing to the public. PArticularly good are issues which are complex to the point that categorical statements cannot be made (e.g. This chemical is not toxic). There are then all sorts of opportunities to take statments out of context in these complex matters. The only brake that conrols the media is that of advertising revenue. I see plenty of advertisements in the newspaers for cigarettes, none for agricultural herbicides. 
Govenment agencies can do an effective job in supplying information to those that ask for it, for they are not in the business of pushing propaganda or force-feeding the public. However if and issues suddenly becomes prominent, as a question in Parliament or pressure on the minister then speed becomes the main consideration in supplying an answer. Such answers may not, therefore, be as scientifically sound as they could be since the chain of desks throug the bureaucracy may be long. The scientist may not have been contacted in time. My own impression of govet depts is that they are essentially honest in attepmting to supply infobut that they long delays in the bureaucracy give the public the idea that this info is being suppressed. You get the choice between an off the cuff answer which is factually dubious or a considered reply which may come next year.” 


Even though the author states his distaste for what he calls the popularisation of science efforts, which are of the “fancy that” variety, I think there could have been a better way of presenting this information to a lay reader. This book is like a watered down textbook, with personal opinions thrown in to make it lighter. Quite a lot of the personal anecdotes are worthless, because they are half remembered or self indulgent. Although he eventually admits that the papers he has recommended people read to further educate themselves might be hard to find without the help of a patient librarian (people probably did make more use of librarians, but still I think this is a large barrier. Being recommended text books, govermnet reports and academic papers is offputting. Why not take the time to read around the field, which was much smaller at the time, but it did exist, to recommend some reputable and balanced accounts? It seems as though this author did not do any reading to find out what laypeople might be more comfortable with, so has stayed to the format that he personally as a career long biochemist is familiar with. Irritation and impatience are the dominiant tones in this book for me, classic hallmarks of blustering sceptics who despite being passionate for evidence, and reason, do badly at convincing anybody they label as irrational to be otherwise by delivering their message in such an unpleasant and condescending manner, I really have found this book unpleasant to read. Telling people that they can’t have an opinion until they’ve digested the facts yet at the same time asserting that the facts are hard to access, let alone to interpret, is pretty much the jist of this book. 

Crone also fails to address in detail how journalism and press reporting works, referring instead to a couple of reports and continuing to harbour a prejudice about the media making issues out of things in a completely simplistic manner. The media is not homogenous and is knowledgeable about its readership and its nonreaders, something to which Crone is oblivious if we consider his confused view of the expected audience for his own book. Therefore, they will write about what their readers want, in a way that they think they will be able to digest. Journalists may not be trained scientists, but they are good at making stories attractive and asking insightful questions, relevant to their audience. There will always be some bad journalism and I think that this would be an interesting point to follow up - though possibly not now, but as a minor theme, someone may already have done it - but how has science journalism and the reporting of environmental, chemical and health issues changed during the time I’m looking at? Dorothy Nelkin’s Selling Science is actually probably the thin I need to read next.  Crone does not consider the skill of summarising complex information or picking out the interesting parts when writing for a nontechnical audience, becauase he has not managed to do this for his own book.
