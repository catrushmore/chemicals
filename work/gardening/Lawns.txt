Lawns

Loads of books in the library after all, though most are practical guides rather than analytical. 
Tom what sits book might be good, though from the reviews it might focus on lawn mowers, unless the reviewers were lazy and just looked at the cover.

frequent mowing checks weeds
plantains thistles and dandelions must be taken up about an inch below the surface. A pinch of salt or 'daisy destroyer'
p25 dropped on the cut root will prevent new growth. The lad who does this woe should understand what he is about for a plantain merely cut off just below the collar will send half a dozen shoots in the same manner as sea kale and prove a greater nuisance than the original crown; and the careless use of salt will kill a lot of grass plants. 
Quicker to score the weeds deeply with a knife and lay a pinch of 'daisy destroyer' on the cut. Dip a wood skewer into sulphuric acid, carbolic acid or one of the liquid weed destroyers and then plunge the skewer perpendicularly into the heart of the plant. the result is deadly and instantaneous. The use of these destructive fluids needs great care to avoid personal injure or the burning of holes in clothing. The bottle containing the liquid must be kept in a place of security.

Grass
MacSelf

p96
a weedless lawn should be the perpetual aim and supreme ambition of every lawn and green keeper to free his grass from weeds. 
Common custom to deal somewhat summarily with the question of weeds in grass sometimes by advocating the liberal use of proprietary lawn sands which are impregnated with chemicals of a caustic nature, [and sometimes by hand.] 
p101
chemical lawn sand may very well be used for destroying daisies on areas that are of greater extent than can conveniently be dealt with in the foregoing manner, and with careful handling it will be found more economical than hired labour for hand weeding. 
**suspicion**
Often occurred to me that mfcrs of lawn sand err against their own best interests by refraining from making their instructions for using lawn sand as explicit and comprehensive as possible. One may read that there is no danger in the use of lawn sand and that the grass  and weeds alike may be covered by ... Some users will buy a good deal more lawn sand than is really necessary, but I am convinced that many more are reluctant to give it a trial under the supposition that sufficient quantity to do any good would cost an extravagant sum, am also sure that in v freq instances larger quantities are actually used than are at all ned to achieve the desired result. 
Unnec to delve into the secrets of composition of proprietary brands but the principle may be explained and the user may obtain clear idea as to the method of application that will be at once more effective and economical.

'find its way past all foliage and thus come to rest on the earth will expend its strength in a futile effort to burn the soil'

p64
lists Carter's products in the complete grass fertilisers, but also the generic fertilisers, superphospate of lime, dried blood, nitrate of soda, potash
p65
fertilisers not foolproof. 
p66
"I  have however been able to devise a complete grass fertiliser, sufficiently soluble for practical purposes. The importance of this discovery cannot be over estimated, as it does away with all the dirt dust, smell and labour associated with preparing dry fertilisers of use by mixing them with dry finely sifted compost ... 
p67
... the insoluble matter and heavy particles which sink to the bottom inspire ov vigorous stirring will not exceed more than a small part of the whole. This can be thrown on the compost heap or scattered over the flower beds; it need not be wasted. 
p71 mentions Adco Accelerator by name though uses quotation marks. 

Deals with weeds sensitively, 
p75A weed is a plant growing out of place. 
life is always present in all soils in the shape of seed or spores waiting for a chance to grow. If this were not so, all life would perish. 
p77
there are tens of millions of pounds spent on education and yet there are many who cannot understand that when weeds comp up i a lawn or elsewhere it si a perfectly natural occurrence, in fact it would be unnatural if they did not, because every part of the earths surface contains seeds or spores of some sort of weed or another. 
It is pathetic to think that is should be ned to endeavour to teach such an elementary lesson......
it has now been made abundantly clear that weeds are a natural evil in all cultivated crops and it is equally clear that unless they are killed as they appear they will win the battle and in the case of a lawn quickly ruin it. ... small lawn size of bowling green can be kept free of weeds if the man in charge has the **strength of mind** to do it.
p78
larger areas entail more work and the q of cost comes in to such an extent that it may be impossible to cope with the weeds - suffered with reluctance. [interesting that he does not suggest weedkillers here]

Hand weeding -

importance of weather conditions
broadcast treatment with lawn sand - multitudes of all sorts of weeds given a broadcast dressing of Carterite or lawn sand.

lawn sand is highly caustic, burn everything inc grass, kill upwards of 80% weeds. 
p81
spot treatment - when distribution of weeds makes broadcasting uneconomical
using lawn sand again (does not suggest Carterite this time) in a conical distributor to drop onto the weed - a **saltspoonful**
p82
Plaintainkil suggested as alternative to lawn sand (but not pressed as superior) for plantains. 
liquid weedkiller for dandelions but has not mentioned a liquid preparation before. Prepare the weedkiller at double strength, use a weedkiller ejector (syringe?)
p83
squirt a little weedkiller on each
this is a simple method, far easier than riffing them out or spiking the roots and injecting the weedkiller as the latter practice calls for nerve wreaking accuracy. If the ejector releases too much of the weedkiller at a time, it can be corrected by partly blocking up the spout with a matchstick.

Advert at back
Carters invented the original non-poisonous Wormkiller without which winter sports could not possibly have attained their present scope or popularity.

Carterite is a preparation manufactured by us for the total extermination of daisies and other shallow rooted weeds on putting greens and lawns etc.

1940 Better Lawns for homes and parks
USA

This book is against the acid soil process
p153
In following this theory home gardeners have applied sulcate of ammonia and  other acid forming substances and have withheld lime. ...greatly reduced vigour of the grass. weeds are fully as acid tolerant as turf grasses, certain iof them inc crab grass and red sorrel will grow with the soil is too acid and infertile to support the desired grasses. Produce sod bound condition - unhealthy accumulation of dead grass roots. 
p154
sterilisation of the soil with chemicals
p155 usually has little effete on weed seeds even though living plants are killed. 
p161
the use of an ordinary oilcan with a long spout to place two or three drops of kerosene on the crown of each plant is fully as effective and much more rapid and less laborious than digging up the plants. (combating platains and dandelions) 
explains best treatments with reference to why things won't work, based on the plant's morphology - this is partly to aid recognition for hand weeding, but also to aid application of chemical means (e.g. kerosene) or what he separates out as chemical weedkillers. 
p167
Chemical control of weeds is far less tedious than hw but it is in no way a substitute for good management practices. None of the chemicals discussed here will kill weed seeds in the soil nor prevent the germination and growth of weed seeds that are introduced from surrounding weedy areas. (emphasis very much on prevention through soil management, understanding impacts of different treatments) 
p169
Precautoions 
these weedkilling compounds all present some hazards in use to the person applying them as well as to the turf. Sodium chlorate in intimate contact with clothing, shoes and similar materials becomes a fire hazard and burns with explosive violence when dry. 
Urged to removed and carefully wash all apparel after using this, and to avoid spilling any of it dry or in solution on wooden floors and other combustible materials. 

strong stomach poisons (other chems - perfectly safe if wears a dust mask, washes hands and prevents piosn entering mouth/nose.)

p172
sodium chlorate on crab grass and similar weeds. Washing of all substances with an abundance of clear water before they have a chance to dry is a good precaution. Chem is completely water soluble and easily applied as a spray.
also used in combination with sodium arsenate (the white grade of this is preferred for weed control - does not explain what other grades there are. )

Introduction
an outdoor garden in Britain without a lawn would be an anachronism for the incomparable velvety green sward which our island climate makes possible seems essential to garden beauty as a whole. 

WH Hudson naturalist - not into lawns. Would rather see daisies in their thousands etc... than the too-well-tended lawn
pre send day gardener writer whose work appears in the best of the hort mags has expressed the view that the plant composition of the lawn is not very important provided it gives a green background to shrubs, trees and borders when mown. 
to the majority of modern gardeners the garden lawn is a fine even lux carpet of ... essential to the outdoor scene as the will carpet is to the indoor drawing room. It is to the seekers of such lawns that this book is addressed and dedicated. 
In garden hist, the lawn is comparatively recent innovation. First records of turf plots kept kept by mowing and rolling go no farther back than 17th c, first lawn mown machine not until 1830 (no mention of chems) 

p9
lawns basic indispensable roles, first features to be thought of planned and laid out. Lawns are a cardinal expression of our national hort genius and set a standard for th rest of the world. 
although the practice of bedding out has fallen under a blight of expense form its former huh estate, the grass lawn is still the finest foil to well grouped annuals and summer flowering plants. 
good turf gives a pleasant g against which the blooms shine and sparkle in a way they cannot do against duller stone or gravel. 

mainly description of weeds
has a photo to show the overgrowth and distortion of daisies after the use of MCPA - quite useful to see what the effect will be
p68
indirectly weeds are discouraged by regular mowing. does not remove them but compels them to dwarf their growth and removal of flower heads checks reseeding. 
weed free seed bed and clean seed - kept weed free by maintaining acidity, feeding with superphosphate and then sulphate of ammonia. 
p69
direct destruction the amateur greens man has several herbicides he can use
(says he, though there have just been quite a lot of photos of women using lawn mowers & edgers of various kinds)

general purpose lawn sand (same proportions as other book)
broadcast or spot trot - April to june weeds are most active, have vulnerable growth. 
selective weedkillers - within the past ten yrs, lawn weed control has been revolutionised by more powerful selective weekillers than lawn sand. Based on disc and synthesis of substancees which have profound effects in regulating plant growth. pop called plant hormones, thugh scientists prefer to term them plant growth regulators.

There are specially made implements. danger of too much weedkiller and poisoning surrounding soil and grass.

weed control - thriving turf, maintenance.

p205
some veterans and some who fear chemicals, still do it [by hand]. Safe not too devious with few weeds. Modern arsenal of chem generally cleans up the lawn as effectively and much more daily. 

granular herbicides applied by spreader, as well as the now familiar spray concentrates. Clear instructions accompany reliable brands. [no mention of which]
environment - much concern, unduly fearful o herbicides. Almost none of the herbicides available to the home owner are any more toxic than aspirin salt or gasoline. Every material used carelessly can be dangerous, read instructions follow faithfully. Use gloves, and protective clothing, avoid breathing fumes or spray, bathe after spraying or spreading. 
p206
short of something like a child eating or drinking pesticide there should be no problems.
trend to soncumer protectionism has drawbacks. Useful producers are being denied the homeowner because legislation dictates only applied by licences prof. 
most people want to kill weeds at odd moments, without great expense, and it is to be hoped that restrictions won't extend too far in presuming the hometowner to be completely irresponsible in his ability to handle weed kilers judiciously. 
debt costs and proving safety to govt satisfaction has become so costly that the search for new products and prep for market is  unprofitable. 
...
p222 Paraquat is excellent for killing all green vegetation contacted. Althoguh useful for a chemical scorch before renovation, it does not affect plant parts in these soil such as rhizomes which later send up new sprouts. The chem is imm inactivated by the soil and seeding can follow within a day or two. Unfortuantely paraquat does not have label clearance for home use, only agriculture. 
Phytar or ansar (sodium cacodylate and methane arsenic acid salts) behave similar and are marketed chiefly for ag uses. A little as an ounce of paraquat with one fourth ounce of wetting agent in a few gallons of water is suffienct for scorching back hundred of square feed of unwanted beg. Scalping an old sod shortly before tmt will require less paraquat or phytar soon as less veg to be coated. 

p228
common misconceptions
weed menace to lawns is increasing
as the standard for lawns are raised, there are fewer weeds although these may be noticed more. Never have there been so many efficient chems for aiding weed control. Many that were once v diff to control are now easily eliminated with herbicides.

2,4-D and 2,4,5-D controvery
amazing example human gullibility ...
cancer
feeding tests - DSMO was used in these tests - known carcinogen
If authorities wish to ban these two chems on food crops as a result of these non conclusive tests it would be no real loss We hav more effective though more costly controls for ll the weeds that 2,4-D and 2,4,5-D kill. 
absurdity of suggesting that they also be banned for use on home lawns reveals new dimension in man's ability for self-deception. I have even seen recommendations that pregnant mothers be kept off sprayed lawns for fear of prenatal toxicity to the unborn!
p104
it is conceivable than an amount of either chemical squat to about one drop in a tank car of water could be picked up by casual contact, the actual amt of material used on 1000 sq feet of lawn can be measured in milligrams. When however we postulate a situation where perhaps a hundred though sand times that amount could be picked up by repeated contact, my only comment is I hope my life will continue long enough to make such contact possible. 
It so happens that  I can testify to at least one case of exposure over a fairly long tim whtouth indication of any difficulty. In 1943 I began demonstrating the nontoxic nature of 2,4-D to skeptical audiences by swallowing enough 2,4-D in water to kill the weeds over an area of 1000 soft. Originally 30 such does were sent in separate vials by the  late Dr Frankline D Jones who patented the 1st 2,4-D product. I used these up and later Dr Rober Beatty of the Amchem Corporation sent me 10 additional vials. These too were swalloed in front of 8 live audiences and 2 appearances on television. At the age of 71 I have still to detect any evidence that these doses (each of which was perhaps 1000 times as  potent as any that could be picked up by even prolonged contact with a sprayed lawn) has done me the least bodily harm.

You as a home owner must make up your own mind whether to continue using these invaluable chemicals.

It can be purchased as a liquid or as crystals and when made up with water according to the mfcrs instructions can be aplid direct from a watering can fitted with a fine rose or a sprinkle bar specially made for the purpose. In a few days the grass and weeds will start to wither ad when all are brown they can be dug in with good expectation that most will not survive.

why should men care so much about lawns? 
Prof Michael Argyle social psychologist
something to do with men liking and using machines at work and transferring that bias to the garden - permitting them automny and freedom usisally denied the b bosses. Agreed that me preferred the destructive side of garden care to the creative. Instinctive response on encountering a man with a keen enthusiasm for flowers would be to assume he was homosexual. 

Halla Beloff psychologist
agreed with correlation between work at the place of work and work in the garden. Objection that most working men had little to do with machines any more - traditional roles, mend should be driving noisy machines, wielding sharp implements and deploying muscle power and that being frustrated in role fulfilment made them more inclined to grasp engine of destruction when in the garden. 
p203
mowing infrequent, maybe once a week. Would men be so mad on mowing if it was like housework - daily? (HB)
