SEcond Nature

essay style, conversational, personal account. Not scholarly though refers in passing to other formal gardening books. American, crabgrass, watermelons, letting neighbours down. Not sure that I can use this. 

The paper that reviewed this book didn't like his attitude to dominating nature

trying to find a middle ground rather than extremes of organic, if not virgin ground it is lost, fallen irredeemable, handed over to the jurisdiction of that other sacrosanct American ethic: laissez faire economics. 

he is interested in the preservation of old varieties and distribution of seeds, he was seduced by the design and ethos of the hippy, anarchist catalogues and wanted to create an heirloom garden. I don't see why the paper took exception to his dislike of the Dolly Parton rose.
