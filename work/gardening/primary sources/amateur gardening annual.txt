“It is not easy to simplify the approach to the matter nor is it easy to avoid reference to proprietary names rather than the names of the basic materials. After all, when the gardener buys it over the counter he buys it as brand X or Y as the case may be. 
Have an understanding of the method by which the materials affect the plant. Groups as those that are totally absorbed by the roots or selectively absorbed by the leaves - sodium chlorate and 2,4 D b)contact or translocated weedkiller s- paraquat and dalpon c) preemergence or post emergence types — fenuron and linuron, d) soil acting residual weedkillers - simazine.   [attempt to help user decode and understand what chemical they’re using by thinking about its mode of action]

with regard to the names - the list of approved products under the **Agricultural Chemicals Approval Scheme** will be of real help. From the availability point of view unfortunately, the economics of the business often make it difficult to meet amateurs needs. 

 The interest of amateur in maintaining a weed free lawn = ready market for selective materials and control of broadleaved weeds.   
 “On the whole the user should avoid contact with the undiluted materials and with some steps should be taken to avoid contact with animals, bees and fish. One rather too common source of damage is due to the failure to wash out throughly and at once, any watering cans of sprayers which have been used for applying the material” Article ends on “Modern herbicides are a new tool, bringing fresh problems but undoubtedly a tool with a future.”

Feeds (often non specified), soil sweetening, fertilising taken in the stride, chemicals and manure suggested on equal footing (though usually chem then manure is as good type statement)

Most articles are garden design and planstman orientated, smaller selection of tool review and small selection of chemical type issue e.g pests and diseases, fertiliser

36 articles 2 are chem focused

1967 − 1 article out of 38  “Combatting Pests and Diseases” 

1968 − 3 out of 30 (lawns, dwarfing compounds, sprayer)

1969 − 1 or 2 out of 32 ( organics or from the bag, soil sickness and what to do about it)

1967 - pests and diseases  AGL Hellyer
“So miscellaneous are these disease causing organisms that again if one wants a term to embrace the lot is has to be something vague like “germs”. All the same it is v impnt to distinguish between creature and germs, for in general they need quite different method of control. astonishing  that this basic fact is sometimes overlooked ant that chemicals designed to deal with pests are used for diseases or vv.” widely effective chems usually capable of killing a lot of useful insects as well as harmful ones and for this reason should always be used with discretion. No applied to plants in flower, lest bees visiting the blooms for pollen or nectar get poisoned. 

Meanzon - absorbed by plant, carried about in sap. Cannot by wiped or washed off so may be eaten. Unlikely to do any harm but there are other chems of this kind that are much more poisonous to mammals. Sometimes weeks must elapse before they breakdown within the plant so these chems are not so suitable for food crops. 

Many extremely poisons to human being sin concentrated state though harmless when diluted o the right strength for spraying .The most dangerous kinds are not available for general sale to amateurs but even some of hose that are need to be handled with care. Mfcrs usually state v clearly on the container the safety precautions to be observed and these should always be strictly observed. 

fungi - usually based on sulphur r copper - lime sulphur and Bordeaux mix

sprayed  chickweed with paraquat weedkiller on Friday and by followeing Sunday morning the chickweed was a rick brownish yellow. The remainder of the area was with the paraquat too, this was to kill the coarse grasses and other weeds. Longer for the same effect to be seen. On the sunday following, began to turn over the ground with a rotary cultivator. Paraquat had killed all top growth, but roots of perennial weeds had not been killed, picked off and forked out . Other weeds could be killed later with selective weedkiller but this would no affect couch grass. Sprinkled some organic based all purpose fertiliser over the whole area a he rate of a large handfull per sq yard.

p98-101 Walter Heydecker Dwarfing Compounds and their possibilities
breathless article about the effects of newly discovered chemicals in plants
complex organic chemicals with exceedingly impressive chemical names and shorter but unfortunately not entirely standardised popular names namely (2-chloroethyl) trimethylammonium chloride (CCC or Cycocel); N-dimethylamino succiniamic acid (Alar, B 995 or B Nine); tributyl 2, 4 - dichlorobenzyl phosphonic chloide (Phosfon) 
[doesn’t actually say whether these are available to the amateur]
Fphosfon though convenient to use is not eh least common, perhaps because of its poisonous properties. 
Cycocel and BNine that most of the research work on dwarfing compounds has been done. .
Article ends with
“Quite clearly the future looks exciting. But we should never forget that playing with physiologically acitve chemicals is playing with fire; the greatest care should be exercised in their use, especially on edible crops.’

p81-83 (p82 ads unrelated) Organics - or from the bag?  Henry Tod PhD
fertiliser vs organic manure. 
soil structure
available inorganic plan foodsd. 
not enough organisc manure to go around - horses no longer primary traction
manure not a rich source of nutrients, only the old heavy dressings must be applied. Defciet must be made p with fertilisers. 
Here I must stress a point which the extreme advocates of “organic cultivation”deny, and where hey are compleely wrong. Must have N, P and K and these are the same elements no matter whence they are derived. 
nitrate applied as Chilean nitrate - that is sodium nitrate - is just he same as nitrate produce by the action of microorganisms breaking down animal protein in slaughter house waste or dried blood. Same nitrate that these organisms produce in the soil from ammonium sulphate fertiliser that has been applied to it.  etc etc. 

“Rather than purchase “straight” single ferts it is better to use the compound ready mixed fert which are suitable for almost all the various cops or plants that we may grow. If the average gardener had an notion of just how difficult it is to produce a uniform “mix” pf two three or four diff substances and get an even dist on the soil he would never attempt to make up his own concoctions. 
The big reputable fertiliser firms have far too much to lose to make mistakes or give unsuitable mixtures. They run extensive trials all over the country before their products are marketed  and while sometimes they will recommend heavier dressings than we, the soil scientists, would apply we do do not quarrel with their grades or the purity of their products. Any saving between ready made and homemade fertiliser mixtures is usually marginal, esp if one takes time and safety into consideration. Making up some of these home made mixes can be really dangerous in terms of fire and even possible explosion. The factory has is own special precautions but have you?
 “image caption: only by combining use of chem fert  and rotted organic matter that the problems of feeding plants can be rationally  worked out”

soil sickness - eg nematodes
dug in farmyard manure encourages a race of fungi which trap eelworms and suck them dry. 
D-D dichloropropan-dichloropropene mixture = excellent but can kill plants as effiencntly as eelworms
atomic irradiation of the soil is an interesting devt for the future (!!!), for the present steam sterilisation is an exellent non chemical method but only really feasible for potting composts, not practical in amatuers borders of greenhouses. 
Soil ster by means of steam or the poisonous tear gas - chloropicrin, elminate all brands of specific replant disease though the former is technically out of the question for amatuers.  [does this mean that some amatuers use it? even though they’re not supposed to be able to get hold of its]

“Chemicals: Where do we stand? AGL Hellyer
scientists commonly regarded as either magicians or monsters. expected to provide a remedy for every ill  and when they fail or their remedies are partially successful they are charged with incompetence, neglect or a complete disregard for safety. 
compalint today too many remedies and too litle info about their comparitive value for the tmt of garden plants. Most research is carried out for agriculture or commercial horticulture. Private gardening, and particularly that section of it concerned with ornamental plants, get little attention and must manage as best it can on the overspill from the large scale work. Man of the plants grown by gardeners are completely unkown to the research workers and that goes for some of the pests and disease. 
Quite often the gardener must carry out his own experiments, drawing on what information he can and applying it with commonsense. Always safer to expt on ornamental rather than food crops. Still prefer not to use systemic insecticdes on food crops but exceedingly glad to have some of the m for use in the flower garden. 

BHC impart unpleasant musty taste (wireworm killer used as aldrin adn dieldrin withdrawn)  “dreadful persistence and consequenct tendancy to build up to dangerous concentrations. 

Many gardeners who are afraid of chemicals in general are quite happy to use derris since it is obtained from plants and so seems to them more “natural” than a synthetic chem. Nicotine is a plant extract and is a powerful and dangerous poison. DDT I think must be on the way out as a garden insecticide, if only because it has had so much adverse publicity. Its persistence in the fat of animals (inc birds) is a matter for concern and many gardeners now refuse to use it on that account. 

In practice as used  in gardens neither chemical [trichlorphon or malathion, organophosphates] is likely to cause any harm if rubber gloves are worn when handling concentrates. There may be occasions when med advice is not to use any organophosphorus compounds and the very fact that they can be dangerous to human beings makes some gardeners reluctant to use them. 

[despite saying DDT on the way out, he shortlists it as a fumigant] calomel dust, captan, bordeaux mix, quintozine (Botrilex) definitely goes over his self imposed shortlist of 6, without even touching on weedkillers/herbicides. I think this indicates where he (and the magazine?) stand on chemicals - they are a useful and readily deployed tool to have at hand, should be kept in stock to be used as soon as necessary against pests. 

Soil sterilisation  is it worth it

JK Ferguson NDA
steam, burning
In addition to these traditional methods much has been done in the last few years to find new chemicals for sterilisation. Original materials used for this job were formalin and cresylic acid but now there are derivitives of these and oher substances sold under a variety of trade names. These are available in both liquid or powder forms. Chemical sterilisation can do a v efficient job but must be carefully handled. 
The most convenient method in small greenhouse is to use chemicals but time must be alowed for them to do their work. Plants cannot occupy the house at this time and as most gardeners use their gh year round this could raise problems. 
formalin, dazomet, cresylic acid

detailed discussion of use of weedkillers
complex chems - not simple chemicals, 2, 4-D, 2, 4, 5-T mecoprop are three popular lawn weedkillers. 
correctly diluted to mfcr instuction, avoid drift and damage by using wide sprinkler bar. Designed to deliver approx the right quanityt of diluted weekiller if the user proceeds at a steady walking pace. (!! did not know - interesting how they would have tested this)
p38 sodium chlorate - total weedkiller
older, still used  great deal though rather serious drawbacks. One is that is is highly inflammable, even explosive under certain conditions, though these are risks which can be greatly reduced by mixing the chem with a fire depressant. Brands sold for garden use frequently have this addition. 
second drawback to sodium chlorate is that is is easliy carried about in the soil in water. May be an advangate since rain will eventually remove it or can be washed out by hosing, but the danger is that the chemical may be carried ot the roots of plants it was not intended to kill.
