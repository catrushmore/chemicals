Talking of the fruits of the earth, that benevolent publicity committee which sits at 68, Victoria-street, and knows all possible things about flowers, plants and vegetables from which it takes its name, issues free each month a leaflet about the home-grown produce available during the next four weeks and the best wasy in which to cook it so that it comes to the table always looking, smelling and tasting of itself at the best. .. The leaflet can be had free on application to the committee during the first week of each month.
