There were a few physiologists, 
such as Alden Crafts of the University 
of  California, pursuing 
the development of  chemical weed killers, especially after the 
successful mid-1930s introduction of  the selective herbicide dinitro-o-cresylate (trade 
named Sinox) for grain production. However, Crafts felt himself a 
lonely prophet, com- 
plaining 
in 1943 that he had "tried for years 
to interest [the United States Department of 
Agriculture (USDA)] 
...  in chemical weed control," without avail. Even Crafts's own 
1942 textbook on weed control, showcasing 
the latest herbicide research of himself and 
his California colleagues, spends only about 
thirty pages on the use of selective chemical 
weed killers, roughly 
the same amount of 
space devoted to cultural and biological control. 
The bulk of the textbook describes then-mainstream approaches 
to destroying weeds in 
infested local areas, primarily nonselective methods such as fire and total soil sterilization 
with 
inorganic 
toxins. In his own research program on selective herbicides, Crafts's ap- 
proach was a trial-and-error  exploration of the toxicity of dyestuffs, especially compounds 
related to the dangerously explosive and poisonous Sinox. Hormones played no evident 
role in his  research. It seems that, before World War II, little relation was perceived 
between poisons like Sinox and plant hormones, even by the plant physiologists most 
concerned with weed control (the exception is one group at Du Pont, whose work was 
largely neglected, as I will soon relate).9


The onset of World War II mobilized many USDA and other agricultural scientists to 
undertake projects relevant to the war effort, primarily by studying ways to increase the 
efficiency of food production (although USDA scientists would also contribute to wartime 
medical projects, including penicillin and antimalarial drug development, as well as disease 
control with DDT). But this was not the way herbicides were brought into being by Kraus 
and his USDA collaborators. Hormone herbicides were developed as weapons, not as aids 
to agricultural or medical industry



Other plant biologists who could-and  after the war in fact did-contest  the priority 
of Kraus and his circle worked in two groups in England: one at Rothamstead Experimental Station and the other with Imperial Chemical (ICI). Both groups were pursuing more traditional agricultural research programs-that  is,  investigations of methods aimed at increasing crop production. 

The ICI group found in 1940 that NAA had a selectively toxic action against broadleaf weeds in oat fields and that its use could increase grain yields. Then, evidently through a cooperative arrangement that involved communication of research results from Du Pont (whose activities I will discuss shortly), they found in field tests with 2,4-D and the closely related compound 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid conducted in  1941 and 1942 that both had more potency than NAA but similar action; this work resulted in a 1941 British patent application on the latter herbicide (trade name Methoxone). In November 1942 ICI filed a report on the herbicidal uses of these synthetic hormones with Britain's Agricultural Research Council. Also reported to the Agricultural 
Research Council that month was the independent work of the Rothamstead group, which had found that 2,4-D persisted long enough in soil to be used as a broadleaf weed killer and growth suppressor. In November 1942 these two groups (ICI and Rothamsted) were asked by British defense authorities to collaborate in investigating further productivity-enhancing  and possible military applications of the synthetic hormones and were barred from publishing their findings until April 1945, at which time several sets of results appeared in the same issue of Nature. 

British sources allege that the findings of the British teams were communicated to the chemical warfare authorities in the United States at the beginning of 1944, although Kraus would claim that he never heard of their work before the 1945 publications, despite the presence of British liaison people on the DEF Committee. The British researchers were plainly irritated that they had been forbidden to publish while American academics had 

Despite 
the cloak of censorship over herbicide reports 
in the biology literature, during 1945 the public became 
increasingly aware of herbicide developments, 
thanks more to industrial interests than to scientists. 
One of the first major stories on the subject in the national media appeared 
in the January 1945 edition of the farming magazine Country Gentleman; it announced the good news that innovative products of  "physiological magic" (2,4-D and 2,4,5-T) "will be ready in  1945 to speed the fight which mankind has made down through the ages to protect crops from nature-strewn, unwanted plant forms which spring up, everywhere to choke and overrun." This ebullient piece focused on the published results of the Beltsville and Cornell groups and noted the potential agricultural utility, in particular, of  2,4-D's selective toxicity aginst broadleaf 
plants. While acknowledging that "giving accurate distributed credit" was difficult in this 
case, **Country Gentleman** awarded the most to "Dr. E. J. Kraus, of the University of Chi-cago, probably the most renowned physiological chemist in this country, if  not in the world," and his  collaborators. ... The article also mentioned Franklin Jones, however, and noted that his firm was manufacturing and selling the new 
compounds under the brand name Weedone; this part of the story probably drew on American Chemical information sources. In February 1945 **Better Homes and Gardens** carried a piece focusing strictly on 2,4,5-T and its (nonselective) power to combat hated garden pests such as poison ivy and Japanese honeysuckle, that "Jap invader [which] has taken over large areas in the eastern United States" and which-in  a continuation of the xeno-phobic, martial imagery typical of wartime-was  said to overwhelm orchards like "a green wave ...  flow[ing] relentlessly over the landscape." Better Homes exclusively credited Jones as the inventor and noted that the miracle product was available as Weedone, suggesting that American Chemical was the main information source. The July 1945 **Reader's Digest** condensation of this story, "Death to Weeds!" reached an even wider audience with its warlike message and generated, Jones would later testify, more inquiries than any story in the magazine's history to that point.24 By the actual end of the war in August 1945 there was little the public did not know about the new chemicals-except that they might have military as well as horticultural and agricultural applications


By the time the censorship was lifted, around the beginning of October 1945, Weedone had been on the market for a year and was being heavily advertised by American Chemical. American, which doubled its market presence by buying out the pesticide business of the rival Koppers firm (and with it the well-known herbicide brand Weedex) 
in late 1945, was not the only chemical company driving hard to exploit the new products. Sherwin-Williams built manufacturing facilities and was moving vigorously 
into the civilian market by the end of 1945, followed closely by fellow giant Dow. While **chemical firms began whipping up a storm of  publicity for 2,4-D,** some (such as Dow) so rapidly courted away the Camp Detrick scientific staff in their eagerness 
for research talent to discover the next miracle hormone that the survival of the military group was jeopardized.25  Other firms hired senior plant physiologists who could build growth regulator discovery programs, among them van Overbeek, who left Caltech to became a research manager at Shell. **The market segment initially targeted was the suburban consumer looking to control broadleaf weeds in grassy lawns** -which,  as Mitchell's USDA group had already shown, required little more than wetting a lawn in summer with a certain concentration of 2,4-D. Thus in 1945-1946 the Sherwin-Williams advertising campaign for its Weed-Be-Gone 2,4-D product featured such images as a fashionably dressed woman daintily killing weeds with a watering can juxtaposed with a stooped, sweating man ripping vainly at dandelions, or a white suburban home with a lawn "strangled to death by thousands of soil-grasping leafy weeds" before treatment but "lustrous" afterward, at a cost of only a dollar. "Every lawn lover on every street in your community is  a Prospect for Weed-No-More," Sherwin-Williams dealers were exhorted, so "'cash in' on the Biggest National Advertising Campaign in weed history!" This campaign alone generated some  175 million advertising messages in  1946. (See Figure 4.) Convenience and ease were also central to American Chemical's campaign, which featured the theme "Kill Lawn Weeds with Weedone" and images of suburban homes with sweeping, spotless lawns. The new **ease and affordability of a perfect lawn was the motif most often underscored** in a host of enthusiastic newspaper and magazine stories on the products as well; ...These chemicals democratized the expansive, 
grassy yard that has helped define the American suburban ideal since the late nineteenth century by removing the need for a gardener. Thus herbicides played a crucial, underappreciated role in facilitating America's postwar sprawl into leafy green suburbia, even if their ecological and economic impact was ultimately far greater as an agricultural technology.


Perhaps 
the experiment 
station weed scientists wished to keep up with their entomologist 
colleagues, who had been, in the words of the historian John Perkins, thoroughly "chem- 
icalized" (converted 
to chemical pest control exclusively, not 
just as one method among 
many, and inspired to emulate the perceived 
scientific rigor of chemists) by 
the wartime 
introduction of DDT.2

Kraus did his share of publicizing among the agricultural scientists; in fact, he ate one-half gram of pure 2,4-D per day for three weeks to demonstrate its safety. 

one can invoke both demand-side "pull" and 
supply-side "push" 
in explaining 
the quick 
acceptance of the new agricultural herbicides.31
