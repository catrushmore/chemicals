Gardening bookshelf 

Reminds that gardening is learned through experience and watching others, not just reading books. Gardening in the 30â€™s she used books from 1910, bought second hand. Even if books were published in my time frame, people might continue following advice in books they already owned, or books they could buy cheaply/ second hand/ passed on. Books publishe din my time frame are maybe more likely to have some kind of commentary on new methods or products, so oral history will be a useful supplement to the actual practice of gardening.
