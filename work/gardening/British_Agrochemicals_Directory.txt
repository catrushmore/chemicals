in 1957 Trade Assocn in the UK representing pesticide mfcrs, importers, and servicing cos formally agreed with the govt they would not market new pesticides for any used (inc home gardens) unless formulation had been cleared for safety by the govt and appropriate precautions agreed. This is the basis of th ePSPS, administer by the MAFF and a condition of membership of the BAA to comply with the provisions of this scheme. 

p11
any new pesticide or recommend a new use for an existing one =
notify Min Ag, provide data to enable minister to decide whether the product can be used safety. 
data required= properties, persistence, breakdown products, mode of action, toxicity to mammals, inc if possible man, likely effects on wildlife - birds, fish and bees. What used for, how to be used, what risks might arise and provide methods of analysis and sometimes details of proposed overseas uses. 
sub-committee of scientific secretariat recommends precautions taken when using the products, which crops used on, interval between tmt and harvest. 

PSPS only relates to safety, not efficacy. 
Efficacy is covered by ACAS, but need PSPS approval before proceeding. When ACAS is approved, the product can display the special A mark. This enables users to select and adverse to recommend, effect and appropriate crop protection chems and to discourage the use of unsatisfactory products.

1978 Directory of Garden Chemicals
3rd edition
British Agrochemicals assocn 
p3
find way through 200 or so garden chemicals now available
explains pesticide as generic term for any chemical used to kill control or diminish pests diseases and weeds that threaten man, his crops, his domestic animals or his environment 

members of association not only mfc garden chems so garden chemicals benefit form the expertise built up in producing agrochemicals for commercial use. 
special garden products committee looks after rht garden chemicsa sector. 
active ingredients the same but those intended for gardeners are often specially formulated and paced so that amateurs can use them safely and effectively. Agchem for professional users should not be used by gardeners. 

PSPS
developed and tested many yrs by mfcrs but before they are marketed they are cleared by the PSPS. ensures no product is recommended util extensive safety studies have been studied and accept by the Advisory committee on pesticides. no industry reps on this committee and composed of independent scientists and officials chosen for their expert k of pesticides. 

p4 
PSPS lays down precautions must be taken for safe use of garden or farm chem, the plants it can be used on, the application rates, and elapsed time between app and harvest. this info must appear on labels and leaflets. 

goes onto define methods insecticides, fungicides and herbicides
p5 - act though the leaves, or through the roots, or both
selective or non selective/total

safe and effective use of garden chems
right formulation of right chem at the right time
read and obey carefully and thoroughly 

points on usage - read and follow directions on label
use recommended dosage
only if there is a recommendation to mix chemicals do so
wash out mixing vessel and spray before and after each usage
aerosols - follow directions, too close or too heavy can damage plants. visible wetting of foliage is not desirable or necessary
do not spray in bright sunshine = may damage plants
with edible crops it is important to adhere to the interval between spraying and harvesting

p6
timing  - important as can effect efficacy 
lawn weedkillesr apply during good growing conditions
follow directions - some active agains established weeds, others only kill newly germinated seedlings
first sign of insect attack
foliage fungicides will not eradicate established infections

storage - out of reach of children or pets, in frost-free conditions
as with other dom chem, not near food
weedkillers must not be kept in green houses because of the risk of plant damage by spillage or by fumigant action. 

disposal of surplus dilute spray - they quickly deteriorate, do not store. empty into outside sink drain, into the WC or onto the soil in premises not on main drainage disposal on soil is preferable

unwanted garden chems - any which have lost their labels or label illegible should be thrown away. 
solid pesticides left in their containers with lid firmly closed and place din the dustbin. liquid products as above. and containers place din duetbin. Further infer available in Dept of Env Report not he disposal of awkward and household wastes 1975

list here is much shorter (obvs)
p15
sodium chlorate - boots
