Your report should focus on self-assessment of the research you have accomplished, and might include topics such as libraries/archives/galleries visited, any written work done, contact with supervisors. You could also include your programme of related studies – seminars, lectures, conferences attended.  You may, if you wish, also comment on the School’s, and the University’s, provision for research students in terms of administration and accommodation.


**ICHSTM Manchester**
July 2013
I attended this intense gathering of researchers and scholars, and was rather overwhelmed at times. As my research spans diverse areas, I hopped between strands of timetabling, covering objects in museums, oral history, publishing, communicating science, histories of chemicals. The presentations were all interesting and gave me reassurance that my methodologies were acceptable, that my topic is quite unique but fits with established research, that I would be capable of presenting work and answering questions in this type of forum.

**CHORD Retailing and the Senses, Leeds**
What I took away from this day long conference was the idea of shopping or retail as an opportunity to educate consumers. The experience of selecting a product, involves communication between the potential user and the product, whether by reading labels, touching, smelling, talking to sales assistants, looking at the general effect of items together, at the idea that the products could be bought as a way of creating a desired lifestyle. The potential users interpret this information according to what they already know about their use situation, what they imagine it could be with the aid of this product. I think aspects of communication are goign to be a key part of my thesis.

**Accidents and Emergencies, Oxford Brookes**
This conference was a good reminder of the diversity of work on risk, communication of risk and hazard. What I was interested in was whether there was any effect on ideas of home safety by people bringing their experiences of H&S at work back home with them, for example in industries that used chemicals. I had a very brief conversation with a woman who had researched the safety of pesticides, so I think she would be worth contacting again. She mentioned a film directed to pesticide workers specifically reminding them to be safe at home, to not hang  up H&S at the door when they went home. 

I have just recieved the thesis of Rebbeca Whyte, Cambridge, who wrote about disinfection and carbolic acid, which was the topic of her presentation at this conference. There are many parallels with her research and mine, so I'm really looking forward to getting to grips with it.  

Now that I have seen plenty of examples of presentations and have done some of my own research, I think I should start presenting at conferences and meetings. I have submitted an abstract to the BSHS Postgraduate conference which will be held in January, and I think I will submit the same or similar abstract to the Science Museum research seminar group (2014), and the Social History Society Conference (April). There is another opportunity to submit a different abstract on sensing and feeling at home, to the Histories of Home subject specialist network at the Geffrye Museum (March), which based on discussions with people at the Retailing and the Senses gathering, was an engaging topic. 

#Archives
My Fresh from the Archives piece on the History of Advertising Trust for Dissertation Reviews was published in October. I contacted HAT again to see if they had any other material on the other chemicals I'm working on case studies, but they do not. They are best for Thawpit and Harpic, and general household product advertising. 

**BFI**
I spent a day at the BFI viewing rooms to see some of the TV programmes I thought might reflected or shaped attitudes about chemicals. One of these was Pesticides Or Posterity, which Tim Boon has also been working on so he kindly sent me the transcript for the missing discussion at the end of the film. This programme pushed back my reference for chemophobia to 1964, considerably earlier than the papers I'd read trying to put a date on the first use of the term. 

Most of the other programmes I watched were from the 1980s, following Bhophal, so Cloudburst dealt with living near ICI plants near Widnes and the measures the company took to prepare for disasters. This included practices of notifying residents, so that people in half the street could have completely different information than the other half. Another programme looked at the Paraquat Action Group in Huddersfield, set up when ICI proposed building a new paraquat factory there. It was interesting to see how some lay people dedicated themselves to photographing factory stacks and reading technical reports, trying to work out what was coming out of the stacks. ICI didn't come off very well at all, I suspect they learned a lot about public engagement and PR from these exercises.  

**ICI**
I looked at the archive listings that Catalyst hold for ICI, and they might have some material that is relevant to chemicals that were manufactured in the NorthWest, Widnes area (like paraquat), as well as histories of the company, staff magazine which I think are available elsewhere (BL), but I need to email and confirm. My partner's family lives in Chester, so it is not a chore to go up there if it turns out that Catalyst does have some things that I should look at or even if they have any existing contacts with people who might like to talk to me or seems amenable to helping me to access people for the oral history strand.

**National Archives, Kew**
I have located files on paraquat, so will be accessing them soon. 

**Mass Observation, Sussex**
I have still not got to the bottom of their online catalogue, which when I emailed for help, they were tried to give instructions for. 



**Museum of Brands**
Tim Boon gave me an introduction to his contact there, although she is currently on maternity leave. The museum manager who is covering the work is quite overstretched. I revisited the museum to check the displays again for the types of chemical products I'm interested in, and my first notetaking visit was thorough, as there wasn't really what I was after. I think that this is not the right time to follow this avenue, although after pressing again with respect to collections not on display, I was given Robert Opie's mobile number with the instruction that he was too busy to deal with my request for a catalogue search.  I currently feel disinclined to pursue this is a venue for oral history strand research. 

**Garden Museum**
This is a very tiny museum and the cafe is really good. They were helpful although they do not have much relating to chemical use - I think the ICI pamphlets they have are in the British Library, and they have an interestingly shaped jar of pesticide. They suggest speaking to the RHS, as did someone I spoke to from the Oxford Botanical Gardens. The RHS advised on the Dig for Victory campaign and tried to work with allotment holders, so even though they have been seen as an elitist organisation, they have been available to provide information and guidance, as well as carrying out their own experimental tests, on using chemicals in the garden, so I will get in contact with them. 


**Oral History**
I am in the process of completing my ethics proposal. 
I still intend to use a combined approach of short questionaire and solicited interview. 

Although we have discussed the use of a magazine to bring attention to the project and possibly to help recruit for a questionnaire, I am uncertain about the lack of control, the possible volume of questionnaires to process. I think that pitching a story to Good Housekeeping that includes using their magazine as a source would probably  go down well, but when I have written that section up properly.

I think that a nice thing to do, rather than a specific  oral history gathering exercise (because of the vulnerable people ethics aspect, as well as the issues of working with groups of people), would be to carry out a session with groups of older people, for fun and general knowledge, as although laundry is a topic of various offered reminiscence session, general housework is for some reason not.  I had hoped that someone was already running something, whether an object handling session or reminiscence project, with household cleansers other than laundry products that I could perhaps listen in on, I have so far not been able to find any at the museums I've spoken to. The people at the Museum of Oxford that I spoke to would be interested in hearing more about the project as it progresses.
