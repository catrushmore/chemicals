Guide to Making Legislation

I was surprised to read about the minimum times - based on how long some of the things I've been looking at take to go through, I'm surprised that it is so fast. I wonder how many actually do this minimum time, maybe just the very urgent things. 

There is  a lot of detail of the paraphernalia, e.g. needing access to printing and copying, which is interesting in the day of digital publishing, but would have taken even longer in the time frame that I'm looking at, with longer print/copy times probably. 

I did not know that the notes and speeches had to be looked be checked over by legal team before hand. Not committing to anything in debate makes sense, as does giving the writers copies of these. I did not know the bill team or private secretaries read over Hansard to suggest amendments - is there a way that changes are indicated in Hansard? What kind of changes would they suggest?
