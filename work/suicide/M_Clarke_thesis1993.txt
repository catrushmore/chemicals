	detailed discussion iof hist of poison legislation in England and Wales

newspapers

arsenic, strychninie cyanide opiates, carbolic acid, babituarate and salicyclates

reasons for selection 
- known as poison for several centuries (a, s)
- first appeared during period of investigation (ca, b, sal)
- principally medicines but lethal in overdose (sal, b, o)
- rapid acting, relatively painless (c, o)

association of particular groups of people with the use of specific poisons highlight - cyanide for photographers, barbs for older, opiates with period before the Dangerous Drugs Acts, carbolic with residents of large towns, swift or painless poisons with the medical profession. 
Importance  of imitation and fashion - increased public awareness e.g. of carbolic

Volume 2 looks like its of most interest - suicide by poisonign with solids and liquids, conclusion. 

p4
availability of means - Farmer, Rohde Acta psychiatrica Scandinavia 1980, 436-446
Looking at availability of solid and liquid poisons has not been attempted before. Contribution of individual poisonous subs generally too small to have a large effect on the overall incidence of self destruction, the availaibity of these materials may influence the total no sucides by poison. 

see ch 5 and 6 for discussion of legislation/ controls and influence on s. 

p5 analysis of poisonig  - certain sex/ age groups, locations or occupations mya have gtr legitimate use of a particular poison. Use of domestic substances by women, disinfectants in the large conurbations. 
p5 imitation - small scale - reporting of unusual means, results in imitative cases but large scale, raised public perception that  aparticular menas is the one to use can lead to a lg no cases over a longer time period. see domestic gas, car exhaust. solid and liquid poisons - see ch 6

p8 from 1850s stats for England and Wales became a regular feature of the annual reports of the Registrat General. Represent true incidence? Probably under represent.

published data divided to show annual no of fatal suicidal poisonings during 1858 -1890 in each county, but this information was not presented in the subsequent 20 years when the total number of S by all methods in each county was given in stead. The amt of detail improved after 1911, total no of S in broad age groups being procided for areas as small as administrative areas, but did not show number of poisoning cases. After WW2 the breakdown in to age groups was removed from teh published reports, data subdivided only by sex.

editorial in Pharmacuetical Journal  - Criminal poisoning 1856 - 15, 289
"It is a notorious fact that the publication of the particulars of a murder or a suicide is not infrequently followed by the perpetration of a siilar offence by some other party, apparently assisted, if not instigated by the infomation so recieved

ediorial : The Suicide Season Pharmacuetical Journal 1914, 38, 634-635
"the suicides reported in the press never represent the whole number of cases, anda n increased activity among reporters at one time or another, or a temporary shortage of more important news may produce the erroneous impression ofa real increase of that number."

p51
early 20C increasing accepted, esp among medical profession, that criminality of S did not have a deterrent effect. View more widespread after WW2, BMA committee recomended decriminalising attempted s. 1958 public opposition to reform of tha law = negligable, time England caught up with the rest of the civilised world. 
1959 - Home SEcretatry asked Crim LAw revision comittee to inquire how law could be motified to retain offences of inciting and assisting, while legaliseing para/suicide. Criminal Code Commissison had dealt with this 80yrs prev and their recommendations were ressurected. Report published in 1960 with draft S Bill appended. 

p52 
initial increase in recorded S following decrim. but generally prove that crim was not deterrent. Declining S in 60s and 70s not attributed to the law either. 
see R Fox "The S drop - why?" Royal Soc of Health Journal 1975, 95, 9-13

p94
change made to the classification of deaths resulting from self-induced abortion. Prior to 1940 thse were classified as suicide and accounted for an average of 42 deaths a year during the 1930s. 291 - see note 156

the new International List contained new categories to accomodae such deaths separately from suicide, and  they were listed along with other abortion related fatalities. Teh annual no cases continued to average aroudn 40 during 1940-45. ref Registrar General Stat review 1940-45 text. p243

p95
open verdicts - until 1931 there was no separate category, incldued with accidental deaths. $th revision of the international list allowed for their separate coding in the category violent death of an unstated nature. 
1939  reverted to aggregating most open verdict cases with accidents. 

8th revision of the ICD first used in 1968 report reintroduced separate class for undetermined deaths, maintained in teh 9th revision. Most open verdicts included in this category, except transport deaths and where the cuas eof death was natural.

p96
inception fo regular annual S stats in 1858 the cases not broken down to show deaths form natmed poisons, though occasional tables for 1852-1856 and 1863-1867 did make this info available. "Posion (not stated)" was approx 30%. 

1868 - special tables for violent deaths, the poisons used were shown and remained feature until the tables were withdrawn after 1949/

critisicm of presentation esp from pharmacy profession - inclusion of substances such as daffodils and marking ink along with medicines and scheduled poisons irritated the ediotrs of the Pharmaceutical Journal, as did multiple entrieds for the same poison. 

p97  "Why in the name of goodness, does the Reg.Gen. have seperate headings for bichloride of mercury, perchloride of mercury and corrosive sublimate?"
(Deaths by poisoning 1901 PharmJ 1903 17 434-435)

A clearer desc of items listed vaguely was called for - liniment, medicine, disinfectant. 
Chem&druggist 1927 107, 533-545 inexact stats of poisoning - editorial

p102
Even at an inquest, desire to avoid a verdict of S could permeate the proceedings. Death might be deliberately isclassified as accidental or "open" to spare the feelings of relatives. Watts claimedin 1975 that coronoers still "bend over backwards" so as not to return a S vertdict.   CAH Watts "the suicide profile" BMJ 1975, 3 .42

p115
Anderson- likelihood of under recording of female S in 19C deflated official stats. Arose beause of women's greater use of equivocal methods uch as drowning and poisoning, and greater tendancy of juries to avoid suicide verdicts in women. Rise in the incidence of female
p116 - domestic gas poisoning. This means becomes all important in 20C, and as a domestic method it was not surprisingly more common among women than men. *I would say that don't a large no s occur in domestic surroundings or with domestic goods?*


p143
poisoning as method is relatively more usual for women, differenc ebetween sexes in S by poisoni is therefore less than s by all methods. Decline in % that were men culminated with excess of female cases in the 1940s and 50s both in pharmacy journals  and Registrar General.

Seasonality - variable but would I be able to find any patterns in my information? IE are accidents / incidents happening at peak gardening or psring cleaning times? 

p173
venues - deaths at home and at work - excess of female S occuring at home. 
16 of 18 (89% in 1850-1899 women at home
104 of 108 (96%) in 1900-1961  women at home. 

44 of 68 (65%) in 1850-1899 men at home
144 of 170 (85%) in 1900-1961 men at home

p174
possibly increased use of domestic gas, rather than emphasis between work and home. 

*not as much attention as I thought might have been given to the nature of work that would have been undertaken by women and men - have read of maids taking poison at work, which is still a domestic env*

p176
preponderance of female S at home in the Oxford poisonig suicides, the Oxford S by all methods and the national poisoining S reflect of course the greater likelihood that a woman would be at home. Women also showed a greater preference for domestic substances as a means of self poisoning, but the question of whether the availability of the poison or the venue itself was the crucial factor cannot be answered satisfactorily. 

*does not describe knowledge of effects, only availability*

p177
much noted peak in the spring or summer was a feature of s by all methods and those by solid and liquid poisoning. Seasonal dist also found in dataset of  poisoingin S compiled from the pharm J, and cases abstracted for Oxford. 

p184
trend towards increased contribution of ingested poisons from the 1880s may hv been stopped by a swtich to gas in teh 1910s. This period also coincides with the rise and subsequent fall in the popularity of carboli acid, a household poison, it is possible that this is evidence of a switch fromone domestic means to another. 

p191 poison classed as non-violent.
poison also concealable (*less detectable?*- more likely to escape classification as S.  - p192 resulting in underclassification


p196
adult accidental poisoning (solids and liquids, not gas) - much less thatn the number of "found drowned" cases, so the result of incorporating these deaths into S data is smaller. 

Men - more adult accidental fatal poisoning than suicides until the 1880s, although incidence of accidental fatalities rose again in the 1940s and 50s as a result of barbituate related accidntal deaths. 

p201
importance of access to and knowledge of particularly lethal means was raised as a possible reason for the sexual variation. Hill reasoned that access was a crucial factor - showing that both sexes had a similar propensity to jump from a height 

p202
significant varioations between men and women in the actual poisons used. BMJ editorial 1882 "males generally incline to the use of drugs, which from their more intimate knowledge of poisons, they know are more likely to be attended with the least amount of pain" while females use strychnine, arsenic phosphorus as well as "other preparations easily obtainable in substances sold for the 
p203
destricution of vermin and... carbolic acid, vitriol and other substances which are common articles of domestic use"   Statistics of fatal poisoning BMJ 1882 1 889

dangerous drugs acts did reduce incidents involving opiates by limiting their avilability (see ch 6). Also a change in commonist poison of women from carbolic acid to its homologue lysol.  (Quoting Pharm J 1933 and RegGen stat review 1932 published 1935)

 Not uncommon to find scheduled poisons available, illegally in widely used vermin and weedkillers. Lancet 1896 and 1904 the sale of poisons - abundant facilities to obtain. 
 p233
 the Act had no immediate noticeable effect on the incidence of suicide. Fatalities continued to rise, led to calls to tighten restriction - increased regulation of already scheduled opiates and introduction of new materials (e.g. carbolic acid)

Factors such as usage, cost, availability, legislative restriction and toxicity 
classic poisons - arsenic strychnine and cyanide
impt medicaments and drugs of abuse
disinfectant
new drugs of 20th C - barbs and aspirin

p270
age of victim - domestic means 
11 of the 62 arsenic suicides were younger than 20. If it was occupational access to substances, would expect that older people (working age) would be represented. [Surely if we think of people leaving school at 14, then going into work, then this statement is put on shaky ground?]

p271
shift from arsenic rat poisons to weed killers in the 20th (as means of self poisoning)
arsenical preps widely used as  weedkiller 1850-1899 but was not replaced by newer/other chemicals as rat poison was. 

employment - access
ag and hort- arsenical sheep dips and weed killer
also medical/dental (though not found disproportionally among arsenic suicides relative to other poisons)
p275
public knowledge of poising as major homicidal poison, ready availability, low cost, widespread normal usage made it an important means of suicide until the first half of the nineteenth centre. p276 Afterwards, legislative control saw its use decrease. Archetypal poison of murder of others failed to achieve such notoriety for self murder after the mid 19th C.

see GR Lynch poisons and poisoning Medico legal and criminological review 1942, 193-202

p295strychnine - very fast acting
place of death - domestic = vermin poison, golf course, train carriage, police courts, not so much work places  although occupational access to subs was impt for women p299

pp294
Battles vermin killer was almost the sole named brand to feature int he reports and it attracted criticism - "not less than seven or eight inquests on persons who have destroyed themselves with this powder" 1887

p316  Fewtrell - medical persons have always enjoyed a monopoly of prussic acid

photographers esp prone to suicies - 18 out of 21 were by potassium cynaide. 
Chemist and druggist linked th use of potassium cyanide by jewellers and soldiers
90% metallic cyanide - occupational access, docs, pharms, students, chemists. 

p325
impt factor in all methods can be the prior commission of a murder - murder suicides, pacts 
often financial worries
p327
workplace often the source - stolen from in 46% instances of stated source (other poisons is only 25%)

strong smell - combatting foul odours
carbolic acid found in most urban households by 1870s
superseded by lysol (cresol) which became a common household substance by the 1930s
lysol replaced by much less toxic dettol (no caps - thought these were brand names?) 

p377
end of 1870s poisoning fatalities by carbolic acid had increased to almost one fifth of all poisoning in England and Wales - ready availability was criticised. 

p382
solid forms of carbolic acid were exempt from controls (sale restricted to chemist) -  had been available since 1870s when hoped that use might prevent some accidental poisonings.
