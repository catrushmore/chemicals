Reinventing intention: ‘self-harm’ and the ‘cry for help’ in post-war Britain

shift from failed suicide to communication - 1950s
where it is seen as a distress signal
there is a social element in the pattern

then from communication to mood regulation through release of opioids  (communication disappeared in favour of biochemical explanations) 

to attention seeking behaviour


people presenting at hospital are scrutinised, rather than simply sewn up or resuscitated - accounting for significant proportion of the people seen by psych services.

epidemic of self poisoning in the 1960s - again distress signal 

"Some clinicians now differentiate strongly between self-cutting and self-poisoning, downgrading the latter (with the proposed DSM-5 category non-suicidal self-injury solely involving damage to the surface of the body), most epidemiological studies do not (the majority of hospital presentations still involve self poisoning. The prominence of poisoning between 50s and 70s might be explained through anxieties around general practitioners over prescribing under the NHS, or drug safety post-thalidomide disaster. The shift in archetypal harm behaviour (mid 80s Britain) roughly coincides with a shift in presumed intent, from interpersonal communication to emotional self regulations, perhaps corresponding to the types of psychological scrutiny available and the fracturing of the psychosocial model of psychiatry. Transitions of language/view depend on a clinical picture made visible by the integration of psych and general medicine in the 50s and 60s."
