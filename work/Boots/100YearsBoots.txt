Italian firm Bencini SPA made cameras for Boots in the 1950s. Has a special place in the affections of millions of photographers. They know that anywhere in Britain one can stop off at Boots and buy a roll of film or leave a roll to be developed and printed and be sure of consistent value and service. 

[Chemicals not mentioned at all here, neither are they in the list of old-time things that Boots still sell, though am sure that that very helpful person said that Boots had lots on amateur photography]

For gardeners
Englishmen spend  a lot of time shopping for their gardens and find a lot of what they want in Boots. Boots helped to pioneer the modern type of garden chem, producing the first Own Brands in weedkillers, fungicides and insecticides as early as 1937. Today's gardener gets a range that covers almost every sort of garden aid and knows that what he is getting is the result of the same research which has been serving farmers and horticulturalists all over the world.
