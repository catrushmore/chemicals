review of poisoning - four well known features of contemporary society
* readiness of the young to consume almost anything that will give them some kind of kick
* widespread lack of respect for private property
* dangers of putting toxic materials into unlabelled or wrongly labelled containers
* power of the media - publicity attached to the first unfortunate accident resulted in 5 imitative suidical deaths. Is it in the best interests of society as a whole for full publicity to be given in press and television to incidents of this nature? as antifreeze is so easily available and so lethal and relatively pleasant to take should not mfcr be encouraged to alter the taste or add and emetic?
