Peter mentioned possibility of doing an article on phenols and their silent removal from consumer cleaning and health care products, following EU directive 2008. Appears to be no online mention of the withdrawal and changes in product formulation (and thus noticing any changes in effectiveness?).

Is there anything in the Times, other newspapers? Not sure Peter has access to these through Science Museum
Might there be specific product info?
Who would have lobbied for it? 
Look for the directive itself on the EU portal.
