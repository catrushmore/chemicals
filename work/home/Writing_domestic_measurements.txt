domestic measurements

When, in what situations, are measurements are given in standard units?

Teacups, eggcups, pails, tubs and boilers are all called on in the Domestos leaflet, but only pails and tubs are given a standard equivalent where the user is told approximately how many gallons each holds. It is assumed that pails, tubs and boilers are all around the same size, this is probably a reasonably safe assumption given the mass production of these items. However, there is not a gill or fluid ounce equivalent provided for the eggcup or teacup. Again, these items are potetially mass produced or must hold an item that is variable in size. 

What do I need to find out about pails etc? When did egg cups and tea cups settle into a standard size?

Plant Protection Limited found that the assumption that gardeners would own a two gallon watering can was a problem for the users who didn't, a common size was one and a half gallons, which meant an added complication of dealing with fractions, a potentially too strong or too weak solution of weedkiller, or even left over granules. The granule preparation was presented to users in packets or sachets that would remove the need to measure out, and avoid the danger of having left overs that tempt storage or being left out and mistaken for something else. 

How did they over come this problem?
