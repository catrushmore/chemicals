Papers of Isabel Fry (DC/FY)
founder of experimental schools where trainign in farm and household duties were emphasised. However, the main period I’m interested in seems to be missing from her diaries etc. two major gaps in the sequence: 1921-1934 and 1936-1940. She died in 1958.

Katherine Jones nee Boyle  (Lady Ranelagh)-  sister of Robert  1614 − 1691
wrote books on household/ domestic science, inc medicine /pharmacy /herbalism demonstrating practices of chemistry, she was using new experimental methods in  a lab built onto the back of her house. 

1660s - Ladies Chemistry became disparraged  [no other references to it being called ladies chem or that it was looked down on other than in Sheffield’s book]

Sheffield mnetions that some female teahcers did not like the substitution iof domestic science for general sciences, as they thought it was bad science. No evidence is given on what “bad science” was here. 

p101 “Ida Freund, science tutor at Newnham College Cambridge published 1911 article infeminist journal the The Englishwoman’s Journal  “erroneous to think that through the study of the scientific processes underlying housecraft and especially cookery, you can teach science, that is, give a valuable mental training tha thsould enable the pupils in after life to judge whether an alleged connection between effect and cause has been established or not.”

p101 Dena Attar (in Sheffield) in Britain girls percieved domestic science was the science for them, took it to prepare for future lives as wives an mothers, boys would take it with a career goal in mind. 

1878 onwards domestic science compulsory for girls in UK

believed that it would make science attractive by making it relevant to everyday life
Scientizing of women’s traditional skills/ work undermined their authority
