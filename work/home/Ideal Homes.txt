greater affluence has resulted in higher expectation of standards of living which households could not maintain with only one partner working

changed expectations and motivations of women given voice by feminist activists in 60s and 70s - Abbott and Wallace '97

p167 Chapman reassesses whether housework is unfulfilling, can it give satisfaction

Mary Douglas 1966: 2
dirt is disorder... cultral practices for removal of dirt are creative and integrative. 

Hughes - 1958 - removal of dirt in employment, delegated to subordinates. Social process as much as a physical one. Most occupatinos have an aspect of dirtiness or deviance attached. 

knowledge gained from cleaning and tidying can be a powerful resource. Exercise of power - strikes among refuse workers and grave diggers in 70s. 

Martin - 1984 - women's sense of ambivalence to the power they hold is that it is unrecognised socially and as a consequence goes unrewarded. 

McRae 1986 - women impose high standards on houseowrk that they belive it impossible that their husband could do the job properly.

	ch 14 The meaning of gardens in an age of risk
	
	Didn't find much here that I wanted - the dates for organic gardening seem to be quite late based on what I've been reading, though this coudl be to do with a change in marketing. 
	More emphasis on environmentalism and cottage gardens, naturalism. Maybe this will be one to ocome back to.
