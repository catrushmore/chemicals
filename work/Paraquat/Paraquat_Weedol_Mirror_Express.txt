Looking at Express and Mirror

lots of adverts, seems to potentially be even less confusion between the cause of poisonings, Weedol not mentioned outside of gardening context. 

Only one advert in 1968 - probably conscious choice about the deaths that were racking up. 

Percy Thrower as model user and ideal user - featuring in an advert for a variety of vegetable growing aids. 

Interesting letter from PPL published too about incorrect usage as pesticide.
