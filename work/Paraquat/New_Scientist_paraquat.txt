1962 - seems to be similar content to the Times and Daily Mail 1962 material about revolutionary chemical ploughing, though this one mentions Jeallots Hill by name. Says that it would be an exaggeration to bid farewell to the plough although useful in some heavy clay situations. Suggests it could be research tool to better understand soil structure and cultivation.

Are ploughs obsolete? SH Crowdy, Plant Protection Lted
erosion of soil, degradation of structure and reduced fertility. 
simplest way to reduce erosion is to use living cover, often not possible in agrucutlre. Dead cover is an option...also allows more effient use of fertiliser because of better root structure, fostered by more even soil temps

Nearer the chemical plough?
Harry Allen of Plant Protection, Fernhurst
parquet rapidly kills green vegetation by interfering with photosynthesis. adsorption onto the colloidal clay. 
existing machines designed to sow grass seeds into turn - not satisfactory. , better results using a machine developed to sow corn. 
generally applicable technique for reseeding not found yet. 
Research sorts out the variations in susceptibility of grass species, might be feasible to rejuvenate grass elys without resort to plugging or reseeding. Rygrass and cocksfood are less susceptible to small dowses of paraquat than the weed grasses. . More work needed. JO Green and Lewis Jones of Grassland Research Instutite uley nr Maidenhead hoped that farmers will experiment with paraquat - more interesting possibilities than handful of research workers .Citied in March issues of Agriculture.

Patents - 
patented it in 1957 but were not able to market product until 1962, not had enough opportunity to reap rewards. Takes patent rights v seriously. 
Extensions to patents rarely asked for or granted. 
in last 10 yrs one other ICI patent has been the subject of extension application. 
Highlights deaths among children. 
Anyone wishing to protest about the free availability of this material would be foolish to to go along to the High Court to suggest that the patent not be extended on the ground that paraquat is not a substance that should be freely marketed. From the environmentalists's viewpoint it may be better to support ICI's claim because he then cows that he has to aim his criticism at only one person. 
*Do not understand why environmentalists are being brought in here, no threats to env have been raised*


Journal of Economic Entomology 1930 (vol23 p867) Richardson and Shephard - describe tests of a paraquat composition as an aphicide. ICI thrown doubt on the claim but on 15 September (no year) Paten 813 531 was altered to take in the phrase " We make no claim to an aqueous composition consisting of 0.5gm of 4-4'-dipyridyl dimethiodide in 100 cu.cm of 1 percent Saponin in water solution  - loophole?

negation of social awareness inherent in the patent system. Exisits to protect inventors regardless sod social merits and although immoral or illegal inventions cannot be patented there is no latitude for the suppress of of an undesirable invention. Growing number of deaths tends to show that like most scientific discoveries it is a mixed blessing.

ICI patently a lapse
Martin Sherwood
opposition entered by May & Baker. 
ICI withdrew before the main hearing, citing market trends. 
patent only covered herbicidal compositions containing paraquat, patents covering manufacture are good for several years, still securely protected. 
If ICI had lost, publicity would have been unwelcome. ICI may have tried to buy silence as the bets way to protect its interest that are no longer covered by law. 
May& Baker - no immediate plans to market paraquat

1974 - Paraquat gets into the lung
unclear
paraquat accumulates - energy dependent mechanism that acts like a pump to remove paraquat form the lungs. The lungs remove various substances from the blood which exit from the lungs, wouldn't be unheard of. 
cites recent  and forthcoming papers = Rose, Smith and Wyatt of Central Tox Lab, in BMJ and Nature.
