Disappointed to read in The Poison Paradox that John Timbrell writes about people committing suicide with Weedol and confusing Weedol (specifically named) with fizzy drinks. It is a popular science book, but this does not mean that he should not be writing accurately. He writes toxicology textbooks and he looks at the grams necessary to be lethal to an adult

3-4g
represents 40-120g Weedol

40g is 1.4 oz

Weedol is 5% by weight paraquat. Weedol comes in 2oz sachets. 
What is the g paraquat in Weedol sachet? 
sachets were 2 oz. (56.6g)
5% by weight
(56/100)*5 = 2.8g

Weedol didn't become notorious, paraquat became notorious. 

I thought Gramoxone had one m? Is spelt with mm all the way through. Definitely 1m. 

1980-1987
more than 1000 cases of poisoning and over 200 deaths in the UK
this must be for gramoxone? Why would the reporting totally slow down? 

p105
mechanism of action
paraquat does not distribute in the body evenly
	it has similarities to a chemical usually found in the body [WHAT IS IT?] for which there is a specific system to carry it into the cells of the lungs
		therefore paraquat becomes concentrated here
		
paraquat exists as a free radical, which is stable (unusual as free radicals usually very reactive)
when paraquat in this form reacts with oxygen, which is plentiful in the lungs, meaning that lots of reactive oxygen is formed. 

p106
am surprised to see he also says "no antidote" without questioning or going into further detail about what an antidote truly is.
