Scientific Subcommittee on Poisonous Substances used in Agriculture and Food Storage 
First Report on Weedol garden herbicide
October 1961

water soluble liquid formulation will contain 0.5lb diquat dibromide, 0.5 lb paraquat dimetbylsulphate, 3.lb Lubrol  silicone antifoam and corrosive inhibitor made up to I gal with water. The maximum container size will be a 20fl oz glass bottle. The recommended rate of application by watering can will be 1fl oz of formulation per 2 gal applied to 15 sq yd or by knapsack sprayer 2 fl oz per gal applied to 50 sq yd. 

Previously submitted data on diquat (Reglone), paraquat not been notified before, oral toxicity greater than diquat, skin irritant like diquat. No mechanism for either yet. The firm claimed that paraquat was not absorbed by the gut and almost completely excreted. 

Limited paraquat use in Malaya - no user troubles reported. Very active towards mucous membrane - would cause swelling and blistering of lips if anyone accidentally drinking it. Medical Officers should be informed and of likely symptoms to be expected.Subcommittee supported firm's claim that when used as described it should not be  a source of hazard when used by the home gardener. 

*So here we have an indication that it wasn't always going to be granules, some thoughts on symptoms (blistering and swelling) that it was almost completely excreted and some indication of use in Malaya*
