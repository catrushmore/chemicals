The Countess of Mar (Crossbench)
asked Her Majesty's Government:

What employment contracts, consultancies (whole or part-time) or liaison arrangements have existed between the agrochemical companies Zeneca and Novartis or their predecessors and the Medical Toxicology Unit (formerly the National Poisons Unit) since 1990; and how many of these arrangements are current.

Lord Hunt of Kings Heath (Parliamentary Under-Secretary, Department of Health; Labour)
There are no employment contracts or consultancies between the Medical Toxicology Unit and the agrochemical companies Zeneca and Novartis or their predecessors. The Medical Toxicology Unit has received funding from Zeneca to maintain a database on the incidence of paraquat poisoning in the United Kingdom. This project was originally set up in 1980 at the request of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The Medical Toxicology Unit has also received funding from Zeneca in 2000 towards the establishment of a specialist registrar position in medical toxicology with an emphasis on agrochemical toxicology and product safety.

The Countess of Mar (Crossbench)
asked Her Majesty's Government:

Whether the agrochemical company Syngenta (then Zeneca) was given access to the medical records of patients who had attended the outpatients' clinic of the Medical Toxicology Unit for illnesses related to exposure to pesticides and to National Poisons Information Service inquiry data on pesticide exposure incidents through the specialist registrar whose post was part-funded by the company; and, if so, whether the explicit consent of the patients involved was obtained.

Hansard source (Citation: HL Deb, 17 June 2002, c57W)

Lord Hunt of Kings Heath (Parliamentary Under-Secretary, Department of Health; Labour)
Zeneca was not given access to patient information of any sort as a consequence of this scheme.

Previous toxicovigilance schemes funded in part by Zeneca collected patient data for the purpose of monitoring paraquat toxicity. Zeneca medical staff were involved in the analysis of this follow-up data. However no identifiable patient specific data has been given to Zeneca personnel by the Medical Toxicology Unit.
