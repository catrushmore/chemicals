(2) when the Advisory Committee on Pesticides last considered the conditions under which paraquat, and preparations containing paraquat, may be sold; and if he will make a statement.

§Mrs. Fenner The Advisory Committee on Pesticides last reviewed and discussed the commercial clearances of the formulations of paraquat currently available in January 1982. The committee has also received a number of information papers on paraquat and the scientific subcommittee has kept the clearances and uses of paraquat under continuous scrutiny since that date. The timing of the next full review will depend, to some extent, on the results of the public consultation on the implementation of part III of the Food and Environmemt Protection Act.
