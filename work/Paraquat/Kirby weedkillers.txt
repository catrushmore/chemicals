Kirby weedkillers

p43 - on developing MCPA weedkiller
Interesting that she says that ICI "automatically" thought of dealing with dusts as they were a fertiliser firm and were used to working with this type of formulation
Farmers did not have to invest in new equipment to apply them
Dusts could be used if water was short

All the focus is on agricultural users, what about domestic ones? 
Boots p45
permission to trial 2,4-D and developed as Lawnox, lawn weedkiller. 
only thought in terms o fliquid formulations as active ingredient small so easier for amateurs to appley the correct does as a liquid than a dust. 
Felt sure that avg gardner would feel happier treating his precious lawn with a powder he could dissolve in the watering can rather than trying to get even coverage with a dust. 

p46 following success with Lawnox, Boots developed agricultural formulation Cornox in 1947

This is interesting, as usually think of industrial > domestic rather than domestic > industrial transfer of chemical technology, though there will be more examples of mechanical tech.
