18.4.69
Mr Holloway, MAFF
writes about publicity for the control over paraquat. 
The Poison Board's recommendations on paraquat were implemented in the Poisons List No 2 ORder 1968 and the Poisons (No 2) Rules 1968 which came int operation on 6/12/68. Mr Holloway was send copies of these SIs but not of the **Trade Notices and circular to local authorities copies of which are within** The circulation given to the Trade Notices appear to cover publicity to the kind of person mentioned in the second para of Mr Holloway's letter and it seems doubtful whether a Press announcement would add to such person's knowledge. 

It seems likely that MAFF have in mind particularly the tragedy of the lewis boy who had a lung transplanted, a report by the Procurator Fiscal on which (copy flagged on **PSN/63 43/1/84)** was circulated to the ACPOTC and we might mention in our reply the exemption for trade or business sales in section 20 of the Pharmacy and Poison's Act 1933. Since this exemption will probably apply to sales by a crofter's trading association  like that involved in the Lewis case. the labelling requirements and the fluted bottle requirement would still apply to such sales. 

I asked Mr Holloway over the telephone a couple of days ago  whether anything particular had happened to prompt him to write to us but that he said not. He said that it had simply occurred to him that it would be timely to suggest a press announcement to us as the 1969 gardening season is just  starting.   *I haven't seen anything about the volume of these fluted bottles - what kind of amount would be sold in a small bottle?*

19.02.70
Miss Maddock, Scottish Home and Health Department telephoned today to enquire what publicity we gave to the control of paraquat. She is concerned because of the 2 fatal accidents from paraquat which occurred in Scotland last autumn.

25.02.70 Mr TL Speirs Scottish Health Education  Unit fwds at Miss Maddock's suggest a copy of the **Guide to the Springclean for Safety Campiagn.**  - guide detached fro retention in Room 301, there is a copy on **DDA/59 58/8/13**

12.03.70
Miss Maddock telephoned on 9/3 + we discussed the paraquat qn, but I did not gather the SHHD had got beyond thinking about publicity + apparently were writing upon a report from the Procurator Fiscal about a fatality. In the circumstances it wd be as well to suggest to MAFF that they consider addressing publicity about the dangers of paraquat to those most to them _ I have accordingly written as whtin to M Holloway of the Pesticides Board. 

12.05.70
Mr McEwan MAFF fwds 1970 edition of List of Approved Products for Farmers adn Growers, and requests wording for a more appropriate cautionary section on paraquat, emphasising the poison law control. The effects of the poisons law control can be stated but it seems doubtful whether they meet the special need for precautionary advice to farmers and growers using paraquat, having a wider object. 

*this is very presumptuous, that farmers and growers only care about killing weeds and that they would not benefit from more caution about its effects.* 

16.7.71
Mr Pickerin MAFF requests in formation that further control could be imposed on paraquat under HO legislation See PSN/65 40/3/19 for Mrs Butler's Question. replied as withing DA Wrigley 23.7.71

10.8.71
Mr Pickerin MAFF requests further consideration of the scope of the"supply" provision of Rule 6 (1) and enquiries about powers to control possession of paraquat concentrate. 

The controls imposed under the Pharmacy and Poisons Act 1933 are chiefly over sale and supply. Certain other powers are provided by section 23 of the Act, eg with respect to the manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations and the storage, transport and labelling of poisons, but it seems clear that it could not be made unlawful to possess a poison under any of these. Nor does there appear to be any other HO legislation under which unauthorised possession of the weedkiller paraquat could be made an offence. 

The extension of the labelling provisions of the Act and the Poisons Rules to the "supply of poisons (otherwise than on sale)" by Rule 6 (1) was made on the following recommendation by the Poisons Board in paragraph 37 of its Report of 1935 (Cmd 4912):- "As section 18 does not apply to the supply, as distinct from the sale, of poisons, we propose that the provisions of section 18 (1) (c) should be extended to cover supply so as to ensure that poisons supplied gratuitously, as for instance by way of sample, shall bear the appropriate warning labels".

I have not been able to trace any papers containing an interpretation of the extension by a court or internal discussion of the meaning of the extension, and the only file I can find on which control over supply of poisons is considered 801, 105/54 (attached) adds very little to the picture. It would not, however seem to be practical to regard gifts between private individuals which will normally be outside the cognizance of any official authority, as being a "supply" for the purposes of the labelling provisions of the  poisons law; to view the Rule otherwise which recognising that the provision could not usually be enforced in gift circumstances would seem to serve no purpose and to be unrealistic. Commercial circumstances of supply other than by way of free samples are conceivable eg the hiring out of equipment complete with poison such as crop spraying equipment or vaporising equipment. (Supply of medicines by doctors etc is not affected by Rule 6, Because of Rule 10). 

To Legal Adviser for his views on the queries raised by MAFF. 
DA Wrigley.

16.8.71
Dr Wrigley + I have discussed + I have now written as within to MAFF. Behind practically ever case of paraquat poisoning in the uK lies the gift or, more likely, the pilfering of decanted Gramoxone W. In my letter of 12/5/70 to MAFF I suggested publicity directed to the farming community, families + employees and I still think that this is the only worthwhile action, short of a complete ban, to reduce accidents.

 I regret that the MAFF letter of 19.1 did not get on the file at the proper time + that its consideration has been too long delayed. When I received this letter I did not think that Mr Staples cd have been usefully approached as MAFF suggest. The probability is that he  wd have refused to cooperate + then caught ? a means to ?? officialdom. It and also have been needlessly distressing to sow the thought that as his horticultural society friends were at fault in the sequence of events leading to the poison getting into his sons hands. I am still convinced that it wd have been a mistake to seek infm from Mr Staples + I have now replied as within to MAFF. There is in fact no evidence to suggest the Dextrone is getting into amateur hands _ these is just a remote possibility that Mr Staples embroidered the cies.? by which it reached him.

 31.8.72 Mr Graham Harrison - fsds cuttings from teh Daily Mail of 30.8.72 and enquires about futher action by the Home Office or the Poisons Board. 
 31.8.72 further cuttings from the Daily Mail reporting that the question of further controls is to be considered by the Pharmaceutical Society. 
 
 1. The controls applying to paraquat under the Pharmacy and Poisons Act 1933 are as recommended to the Poisons Board By MAFF  see PB 890 (flag A). The Ministry is advised by the specialist Advisory Committee on Pesticides and Other Toxic Chemiclas, and it is usual for the Poisons Board to take its adivce on substances used in agriculture or horticulture. 
 2. Since the controls recommended in 1968 were applied no request for review of the control regime has been received from MAFF. The Ministry's last known position is set out in its letter of 1.7.71 to HM Coroner for the City of Liverpool (Flag B) The Ministry have specifically asked us not to extend control until they have considered whether this is necessary - their letter of 16.7.71 (flag C) but they are certainly well aware of the possibilities for extending control - see our letter of 23.7.71. Flag D. SHHD who were considering another suggestion from MAFF are also fully in the picture as regards these possibilities - see our letter to them of 10.3.72 (Flag E)
 3. The Government's attitude on paraquat was explained most recently in a reply to a PQ  on 28.7.72 (Flag f). We were not, so far as I know, consulted about his, but this was no doubt because there are no powers under the pharmacy and poisons Act to ban sales. 
 4.  ? to Mr Graham-Harrison to see, and we might then ask MAFF whether their views have advanced at all, pointing out that it would be difficult to resist a move from the Pharmaceutical Society for stricter controls over sales, even if MAFF are not yet convinced that stricter sales controls will affect the problem of paraquat.
 DA Wrigley 6.9.72
 
 I do not think we need burden Mr Graham-Harrison with the file but Mr Train might care to send him a note on the lines of the draft within. Thereafter we can write to MAFF (cc DAFS adn SHHD) asking for their view regarding inclusion of paraquat in FRI + the Rules

 29.9.72 - 1.10.72 newspaper cuttings about 2 paraquat deaths. 
 10.10.72 Extract from daily Mail - reporting an appeal to the Government by the Pharmaceutical Society
 11.10.72 MAFF- mention development of a thixotropic formulation and say they have decided to await the Pharmaceutical Society's views. 
 
 
 The Society's move, as reported in the Daily Mail of 10 October, was evidently not known to MAFF when their letter of 11 October was sent, but a telephone call from them yesterday made it clear that they are now studying the action taken by the Society. (They wanted to confirm that decanting of paraquat was unlawful only on sale by listed sellers (Rule 15 (1) (a) of the poisons Rules 1971) and they had it in mind to suggest to the NFU that their proposed reminders to farmers should be cleared with MAFF and the Home Office for accuracy). The Society's appeal to the Government has presumably gone to DES, although it may not be for that Department to consider the suggestion that some attempt should be made to educate the public to prevent further accidents We have received (without enthusiasm) similar suggestions from MAFF in the past - see their letters of 18.4.69 and 19.2.72 - and it seems doubtful whether there is much scope for useful Government publicity on top of all the educative publicity already given by the newspapers to paraquat accidents. Stricter sales controls would seem to be more positive action, and signing the poisons book under the Schedule 1 requirements would perhaps bring home to purchasers more pointedly the care needed in dealing with paraquat. However, a meeting of the poisons Board is not in immediate prospect that may not be needed until early next year, and we can perhaps therefore afford to wait for a short time for any further views from MAFF and for developments over the Society's action before a paper is prepared for the Board. 
 Note meanwhile for the Poisons Board's next meeting

 MAFF - fwd copy of NFU circular about paraquat.
 The NFU were evidently misreported in the Daily Mail on the matter of the legality of decanting. The Union are not quite correct in saying that it is illegal for paraquat to be sold by any person other than a listed seller, since it can also be sold by authorised sellers and under the trade or business exemption in section 20 of the Pharmacy and Poisons Act, but it does not seem necessary to point this out to a users' association. 
 DA Wrigley 26.10.72
 
 Mr Morey ? of Press Office Telephoned. He said the Daily Mail had asked
1. Why had there been a hold up in scheduling (in light of reported statement by Plant Protection barrister)
2. How many deaths from paraquat had there been
3. What would rescheduling mean
4. what was the constitution of the Poisons Board

Following consultation with Mr Train I have advised Mr Morey as in w? within 
 
R Kendulls 3.10.72

The London edition of Daily Mail did not run the story this morning. Mr Moley has said he gave the DM information  - in attached note except that he queried item 3 on the lines of Schedule 1 provided a very tight control by registration which limited the extent to which Schedule 2 offered a wider outlet. 
There had been no further Press enquiries + he feels the DM may have dropped its case. 

In discussion with G-H, Mr Train, Mr Wrigley and myself it was agreed so as to be able to provide papers for the Poisons Board, we should
1. Approach the Lpool Coroner for details of the case, particularly as regards the sources of supply. 
2. Consult MAFF for their further views + obtain figures of incidents (accidents or suicide) probably from DHSS. 

We can then consider at an appropriate time if we should write to ICI (Plant Protection) 
for their views.

9.11.72
An extract from the Pharmaceutical Journal of 14.10.72 is now within which clarifies the report in the Daily Mail of 10.10.72 of the Pharmaceutical Society's move. IT looks from this as if publicity outside school education programmes has not, after all, been suggested. 

On closer study of the statistical question, I see that the fixtures quoted in the DHSS Written Answer of 28.7.72 are from the Registrar General; statistics of poisoning in England and Wales details of which appear in the Pharmaceutical journal in June or July each year for the year but one previously (specimens within). A table showing the paraquat deaths noted in these statistics in the ears 1964-70 inclusive is witin, supplemented iwth the figures of the cases since 1970 reported in the papers on this file. It would perhaps be worthwhile asking SHHD if they can provide a similar table for Scotland and we might also ask MAFF whether they can supplement our information in respect of 1971/72 cases. 

MAFF have no details of the Gillian Bate case and would be interested in whatever information the Coroner is able to supply us with.

The reported HO statement is largely based on what I gave to Press Office in connection with the Liverpool case on 30.10.72. ICI again claim to be in consultation with the HO. I have considered challenging them on this but on balance decided against such a course which might do no more than provoke them into making representations. 
R Kendulls 4.12.72

9.12.72 Extract from teh Pharmaceutical Journal
In our letter to MAFF on 13.11.72 we promised to consult them again if we decided to ask the Poisons Board to review the position or if a request was received from some other source for a review. However, in view of the criticism directed at the poisons law controls in the Press last year, it would seem unwise to allow the Board to meet as scheduled on 23.2.73 without affording it the opportunity to review the controls on an informed basis. IF a paper is not submitted it is likely that an individual member of the Board will raise the subject and that the Board will then discuss the matter without prior study of the facts. 
Wrote further to MAFF accordingly, as within. 
DA Wrigley 15.1.73

It would perhaps be as well to consider the form of a paper for the Poisons Board now, leaving it in draft until, say, 29.1.73 so as to allow for amendment to take account of any further information we may receive from MAFF. IF nothing further is received by 29.1.73, the paper can be typed as approved, ready for submission to the Board, and an advance copy sent to MAFF so that they can brief Dr Ashworth for the Board's meeting. 
Prepare paper as in draft within.
