**Keywords:** users, chemicals, domestic, leisure, science communication, H&S

**Abstract**

This paper examines the history of the weedkiller paraquat which was first presented to the agricultural industry in1962, then in a different formulation to the domestic gardener in 1965. Using adverts, product packaging, newspaper and magazine articles in addition to Hansard, I want to show the varied ways that users were imagined, or constructed, and how unintended uses changed how the chemical was packaged, presented and discussed over the following twenty four years after its introduction.  There are questions about how far government can intervene through legislation and enforcement, what responsiblity manufacturers should and do take for investigating and communicating hazards associated with their products, as well as what responsibility individuals should and do take for dealing with herbicides safely and appropriately.  

This is part of my PhD research entitled Chemicals and their Users in the British Home, 1930 to 1989.
