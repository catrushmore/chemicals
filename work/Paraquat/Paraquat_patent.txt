Paraquat patent expiring
(Nigel Hawkes opinion - Science Correspondent, Observer, Whistleblower column )

ICI might help by cutting down the proliferation of diff names: Gramoxone Weedol Dextrone Dexuron Esgram and Graonol all contain paraquat. Some marketed by Chipman Chem Co, some by Plant Protection Ltd. 

Almost 16 yrs since ICI patented p, exclusive rights to market the chem are about to run out. ICI applied to extend patent - v profitable. Or throw open market to any company, prospect which would lead to proliferation of chems and probab much greater dangers. 

Therefore prob in everybody's interest that ICI be given an extension to the patent. But in return for the licence to continue making money, they should agree to modify the forumulation of their parauqt products to increase public safety. If this proves impossible, approval ought to be withdrawn for their continued sale in Britain.
