Do I need to look at doing searches for 
	(kills) germs
	antibacterial
	bacteria AND house OR home  
	
	Maybe I just need to look at the results I’ve already searched for to see what kind of overlap there is (not much actually, though would have perhaps thought it with the ammonia and bicarbonate of soda later on) In fact, germs aren’t mentioned at all with the subjects I’ve researched so far. Perhaps only the toilet cleaner and bleaching powder, but even then, not really. Germs or other signifier of thing to be eradicated during cleaning might come up in oral hisory recordings, though it will interesting to know how much of that is added in relection, rather than the actual motivation at the time. 
	

Quick search for antibacterial on http://www.ukpressonline.co.uk/  gives 1972 the first instance of the term appearing in a paper, and these seem to be product adverts.
