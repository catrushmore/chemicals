the buying habits and purchasing power of the Daily herald Reader [Daily Herald was TUC sponsored - so v much a working person's paper - any readership figures?]

Lavatory cleansers

Powder							45		43
Liquid Bleach					34		33
Scouring powder				26		25
Disinfectants					14		16
Other*								4			4

Some housewives used more than one type, hence the percentages exceed 100
*Of which the most important are washing powder and soda

[does this show that Daily Herald readers are typical and therefore open to advertising for Harpic?]

Grocer was where people bought these products 54% ,followed by CWS 16%
[what is the difference between a grocer and a CWS? What is different about the stock that a CWS holds? CWS - working class? Devotion to dividends?]



13th Jan 1954 
some evidence of falling usership of harpic type cleansers, increase in bleaches. 
bleach thought to be more effective, also used for many purposes and cheaper than Harpic. [Are these powder bleaches, or liquid? When were liquid bleaches introduced?]

the increased use of bleach, scourers, disinfectants and blocks seems to be fairly evenly distributed among all age groups listed.

[what do the blocks do? deter limescale? freshen/deodourise air?
