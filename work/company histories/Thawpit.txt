 Thawpit 

Genuine Refined Scandanavian Spirit of Turpentine
for first class resuts with good quality paint use  a genuine turpentine for thinning
not to be taken medicinally

Bleach - many use scenarios, doesn’t say what the bleach is (e.g. chlorine) or anything about smell, purely cleaning directions like porcelian, woodwork, draining boards, outside steps and bricks,  including “not to be taken” 

Massive ad campaign for Thawpit dry cleaning solution, 

Both men and women cartoon characters depicted using it to take off dirty marks, though in the series of “this is where cupid was defeated” it’s the man noticing dirty marks on the women’s clothes, and although there is a series of “susan, what a sight, nelly so neat” there was no male equivalent.  **Can’t catch fire** is an important selling point, its in all the adverts, as is **no smell**, make clothes last longer as well as not be dingy or grimy. Massive ad campaign explained by ad campaign to trade partners, aim to get existing users to use more, people tended to have a bottle in the cupboard and not get through it  - hence the instructions to have a weekly go over, or to do it every time you take the garment off - as well as to win new users. 

No information on what the solution contains, or how it works, but detailed information on how, when and why to use it.

	Thawpit = carbon tetrachloride, main ingredients are carbon and chlroine. Supplises of sulphur used in the processes of production were to be restudcted but clilents own supplies for 1952 have been secured. The chlorine situation still obscure, but client feels that he will be less affectd than competitors. Carbon tetrachloride is made by Albright& Wilson, bottled and labelled at the Thawpit factory.

Thawpit sold through - chemists, grocers, ironmongers, general stores n Woolwother. Most impt outlets are Woolworths and Chemists. Woolworths has a small size with a cleaning pad attached, made specially, cost 1/-d. Rest in one main size, costing 1/6d

More than half housewives clean clothes at home
The majority of these 55% used Thawpit
Very few users cleaned whole garments
The parts which needed cleaning most were fronts collar and cuffs
Childrens clothes neededmost, mens requierd more than women
Few housewives were area of Thawpits noninflamable property

Client emphatic not direct advertising to cleaning spots, present as product capable of cleaning whole garment. The consumer survey however showed few people ever cleaned a whole garment this way while few housewives appeared to be critical of dry cleaners. We felt that Thawpit although a clear leader in its field was on fairly weak groaunds competitively 

try to persuae more people to clena clothes at home
try increase consumption already in the house. 

Decided to highlight those parts of clothing which become dirty in the normal course of events eg collars, lapels, cuffs
Felt users product bought when a particular need arose, small spaces giving high frequency.

The home market for fabric tints and dyes, spot cleaners, rug and upholstry cleaners 
Agustd 3 1950 
Revised January 1951 (market is USA)

Market Report McCall Corporation
Marketing Resaerch dept 230 Park Avenue New York 17 NY

Spot cleaners - remove small areas of dirt not soluble in water, not effective against water soluble substance or color stains. 
Dry cleaning fluid packaged for household market are intended for cleaning whole articles by dipping and can be reused after the dissovled dirt ahs settled. These fluids contain organic solvents
At one time gasoline was a popular home dry cleaning fluid and its high inflammability made it extremely dangerous for indoor use. Naptha which was somewhat safe on this scene was more widely employed later. Another reasonable safe hydro carbon cleaning solvent is the Stoddard Sovent, horvever, this has a slow drying rate and odor tneds to linger in the fabric. 
Carbon tetrachloride is effective but not easy to use because of its high volatility. Other solvents have become increasingly popular for home use are trichloroethylene and tetrachlorethylene, easier to handle but slower in evaporating. Some commercial cleaning fluids contain benzol or methyl alcohol and the fumes of which may be dangerous if inhaled. 

ww2 shortages of houshold fabrics and other textile products led to incrased interest in conservation.  Commerial dry cleaning services were curtaile or slowed down by man power and material shortages.

Thawpit
Summary of Advertising Experience in Great Britatin August 1945
About 1930 Thawpit was advertised in order to secure distribution, but becasue the adequate distribution to back up the advertising campaign it totally failed. Not advertised at all, attention going on securing distribution. 
Godd reations between clinet and woolwother, and other chain stores, good Nationals dist. 
Personal efforts to get dist through Boots and other Chemist chains were sucessful
Cultivation of best wholesalers, gradually resulted in intensive dist through independed outlets - chemist, ironmongers, grocers haberdashers down to general stores. 

Comptetion  - a number of advertised and unadvertised  brands, generally inactive or not intelligently marketed. Thawpit outspending in advertsing. 
Cleaning aganets - benzene, petorl - combatted in Thawpit advertising by emphasis on relelvant selling point - leave no odour, cannot cach fire
Dry cleaning - avoid conflict

Thawpit advertising passed through following cheif stages 
1)buckeye - frist attempt
2) emphasis on removing dirty spots, taking out grease marks. not effective. 
3) the home dry cleaner - ineffective as thought public were puzzled by the claim of a liquid to be a dry cleaner, not realising that proces does involve immersino in a liquid. 
4) policy of advertising thawpit to keep clean things clean - keep frocks clean and fresh at home, subhead clean clothes last longer. Enirely factual copy and illurations, little attempt at emotional appeal. Hands tipping product onto a pad
5) emotional approach - x marks the spot where glamour failed, Xmarks the spot where she lost his interst. Once past this headline, the copy is factual and on keep the clean things clean - illustraiton of part of bottle showing Thawpit ion lable. 

lies between two undesirable extremes - not limit the use of Thawpit to rhe removal of specific accidental spots, a rarae necessity
does not compte with dry cleaners by advising people to clean dirty clothes with Thawpit which is obviously not its funtion. 
expresses very closely the most sucessful way of using Thawpit, make a habit of goign over the clothes reularly before they get really dirty, esp such places as inside back of neck, elbows, cuffs, waistfront. Safely and profitably be referred to specifically.

looks like a modern day screw top wine bottle. 


“While parazone has an odour very similar to chloride of lime or bleaching powder, it os entirely free from Lime in any form whatsoever” testimonial from public analysit and gas examiner lab RR tatlock and thompson (glasgow)

I have examined a sample of PArazone and find that although the odour is similar to that of a solution of the so-called Chloride of Limeit is quite free from lime in any form and is quite a different combination - another public analyst in scotland 

[This has evidently been a problem - people think they can just use Chloride of Lime and get the same result, so they need two chemist bodies to confirm that it isn’t.]

Parazone in the garden - apply to wounds on alpine plants to coagulate the sap
kill worms in the lawn (not toxic to birds) sterilize sickly pots, sea turf - monthly watering with solition of parazone will improve it [what is sea turf?]

Market research document on housewives using Thawpit - 
criticisms of Thawpit both now and in 1945 make it fairly clear that users have difficulty in not leaving a ring. I feel we must revise the directison to tell them the technique for avoiding this. Also, they haven’t got the point ht atThawpit is non inflamble. Theyr’e presumably not much interested because a) they’ve never caught fire while cleaning with petrol or benine and so don’t see why they should. They don’t particlarly hanker to clean near a naked flame, so the poin is of limited value but ithere it is a sound competitive adantage and we should see that its really clear on the label and also in the advertisint.
