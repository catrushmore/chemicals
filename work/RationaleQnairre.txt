**Broad, pre-OH questionnaire**

Needs to be brief, so not intimidating, but I should be able to get decent information from it in a reasonable amount of time. 

Options - 
		
		* generate interest through PR, people contact me and I distribute q’nairre to them - how do they send the questionnaire back? Does Brookes have freepost? Can I get budget for this?
		
		* generate interest through PR, direct people to online questionnaire
					* limit to those who are confident using internet,
					* stress need for focus to be on homes in Britain

		* approach coffee mornings, existing meetings etc, distribute q to them, then pick up completed forms later - could combine with some kind of presentation or activity?  Would maybe need some handling objects or maybe just decent images... doable probably
				* However, this could generate similar entries - collective memory rather than own, imagination becomes limited by examples, copying etc. 
		

Open ended, free text questions might be best to get answers, as they will probably converge enough to process easily. This was the approach that the toilet cleaner questionaires seemed to take. If I have a lot of prompts/options, it would take up a lot of space and be intimidatingly large

**Ethical considerations**

	* Older people are considered vulnerable, especially those congregating in groups.
	* People may already be, or become concerned about the effects of their use of chemicals, or disposal of unused chemicals.
			* Stress that I am here to find out what their experiences were of using chemicals at home were, that if they have health concerns to speak to their doctors, that unless they were disposin of industrial quantities that the effects are minimal or to speak to an environment agency person?
					* Get in contact with the enviroment agency / local council to discuss what the impact of domestic chemical use and disposal was? Prepare an information pack/sheet.
