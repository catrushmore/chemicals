Letters Mr S Hills
A packet of soup, or a chemistry lesson? 
Enoying my soup, made from a packet, I glanced at the ingredients and was most surprised to learn that it contained “Colourings, citric acid, pflavourings, preservatives, antioxidant, hydrolised protein, sodum nitrite and monosodumglutamate”. What right have mfcs to add these ingrediens to our foodstuffs. Who knows what long term effects these additives will ahve on our bodies? Needless to say I have gone right off packet soups. 

Sir it may resroe your appetites that mfcr can only use ingredients which comply with the food and drugs regulations drwan up ofr the protection of consumers. Under constant review, research independedn experts. Whole point of printint ingredients is that the consumer cn make an informed choice.
