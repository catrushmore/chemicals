Draft of a chemical biography /case study

Bicarbonate of Soda Sodium bicarbonate is today touted as a cleaning material that our grandmothers used. The fine white crystalline powder is gently abrasive when used as a paste on hard surfaces, it makes an alkaline solution that is not painfully caustic, we see it in toothpaste so assume it must be safe to put in our mouths, it benignly absorbs peculiar smells in the fridge. However, these uses appear to be relatively modern in Britain, as home economics manuals, helpful tips in magazines and newspaper articles do not suggest baking soda, sodium bicarbonate or bicarbonate of soda for these uses until the 1970s. If our grandmothers used it they must have told each other about them, rather than writing about it.  

I propose two explanations. One is chemical, the other is related to networks and geography. First, the chemical explanation. There was possibly some confusion comes from the use of the term soda, where it usually refers to washing soda. This is the closely related chemical, sodium carbonate which has similar properties of being alkaline, and  can be used for similar cleaning tasks. It generally comes in larger lumps, and is not intended for consumption or intimate uses such as face washes or toothpaste.  Both these are different to caustic soda, sodium hydroxide, which is also used in household tasks where a strong alkali is needed, for instance unblocking drains. **Look up the difference** Harold Wilson reminisced about a time when camping with the boy scouts he mistakenly used washing soda instead of baking soda when preparing the cabbage (it was inedible, though some would say that cabbage cooked with baking soda is also inedible – there was much debate about the proper cooking of vegetables during WW2). 

These common names, washing soda and baking soda, indicate their principle uses. Focussing on baking soda, it’s food related uses are thanks to the giving off of carbon dioxide when it reacts with an acid. This gas aerates baked goods and refreshing cold drinks made to effervesce. Emergency bread, leavened with soda, is referred to in the context of not being able to get to bakeries or to the supply of fresh yeast in the event of air raids. Earlier **dates**, yeast-free leavening was promoted as a healthful and digestible way of making bread, but to activate the soda muriatic acid, also known as hydrochloric acid, was used. This seems shocking when sour milk or vinegar will do (technically lactic acid or acetic acid) but the use of these scientific recipes is interesting. Irish soda bread is not mentioned, only the scientific explanations followed by the use of soda as an emergency bread. A review of Irish recipes collected together in 1931 even referred to bread made with soda as likely to be eschewed by nutritionists followed by the quotation from the author on her motivation for compiling the recipes "Synthetic flour, synthetic fruit, synthetic juices and synthetic bread must one day result in synthetic people. It is to avoid that calamity that this book is published". By providing the recipe for soda bread, it is to say that it is not synthetic, that it is good bread that can be eaten instead of the synthetic breads on offer (Irish Dishes, BMJ Vol. 1, No. 4020 (Jan. 22, 1938), p. 182), . To modern tastes, soda bread is fairly common, with people more aware of the health and time saving benefits of yeast-free breads.  **There is probably something already on soda bread that I can just reference rather than write this, as my focus is not on food.**

Bicarbonate of soda had a firm place in Britain's medicine cabinet. A 1931 article in The Times recommended that the cabinet be divided into three shelves; one for equipment, one for externally applied concoctions, with bicarb being placed the final shelf for internally administered medicines. It was prescribed by doctors or self medicated for complaints when an acid needed neutralising, such as indigestion. Proprietary indigestion remedies took to advertising the fact that they were not bicarbonate of soda, that they were something different and worth paying a premium for. 
Baking soda was later recommended to be applied externally; as first aid for exposure to mustard gas (1935), for insect stings and sunburn (1938). Medical and beauty uses, such as mouth wash and tooth whitener dominated the The Times advice on the use of sodium bicarbonate. There tended to be two opposing motivations expressed behind the recommendation of bicarb: either that it was cheaper than but as effective as bought concoctions, or that it would do if you were caught without, for instance after being evacuated or away on holiday and couldn't get a preferred toothpaste or cleansing lotion.

Cleaning and stain removal using bicarb was more frequently mentioned in articles in the Guardian and Observer newspapers. Vacuum flasks could be washed out with a weak solution of bicarb to keep them fresh (1932), iodine stains (1933), medicine stains and the removal of scorch marks after ironing or standing to close to the fire (1934) could all be resolved with bicarb, even though the snippets did not go into great detail, they perhaps acted as reminders if these uses were commonplace. The Times did not mention cleaning until 1970 in a feature on dealing with a new freezer, or stain removal until 1986, when the rennovations of the Statue of Liberty had been undertaken and a new stain needed to be explained. *why would these newspapers be so different? Also reports on more political uses eg in hunger strikes and to wash off tear gas*
Between 1939 and 1948, The Ministry of Food placed newspaper adverts in the form of hints and recipes that referenced kitchen uses of bicarbonate of soda beyond leavening that would help alleviate problems encountered during rationing. This included reducing the amount of sugar required to sweeten fruits, and for cooking palatable dried pulses, an economical and abundant choice of protein. 

During the 1950s and 60s bicarb was mentioned in newspapers business reports on chemical companies. The mildew treatment was not suggested, leavening was the principle cooking use. The 1970s saw a flurry of household hints involving bicarb instead of proprietary cleaning preparations. There were not any cleaning products that were marketed as based on bicarbonate of soda during this time.  



The geographical element and communication stategies explanation come from the naming of a mildew treatment and the publication of promotional literature. The American chemical firm Church & Dwight published booklets in the USA promoting the use of baking soda for cooking and other domestic uses.  Church & Dwight regularly placed adverts for the medical uses of baking soda in the American Journal of Nursing. The company promoted their two brands Cow, and Arm & Hammer, which they assured readers were always at hand in the domestic environment. Cleaning baby bottles is the principle non-internal use listed, which implies regular, economical and gentle use, not leaving any harmful or distasteful residue for the baby. Readers are advised to send for a booklet *The Usefulness of Soda*. Church & Dwight produced a variety of almanacs as well as recipes and household hints in which they encouraged the choice of bicarbonate of soda for various domestic uses. Their 1935 booklet *It’s in Knowing How to Use It* presented baking, stain removal, garden and garage uses.  According to the preface of editions of *The Usefulness of Soda* booklet produced in the 1980s, the booklet was first published in the 1950s in response to a decline in home baking, so non-food uses of Church & Dwight products were promoted with renewed vigour. These pamplets are not held in British library collections, and so far, similar pamphlets produced by British firms have not been located. [ordered both – expect in Sept] [Check with HAT to see if they have anything on booklets like this advertised in UK – nothing turning up in BL or Bod catalogues]


References in newspaper gardening columns to the "Russian method"  of mildew treatment (1938, 1941, 1947) also point to national differences in the use of this same chemical. However, this Russian method does not seem to be offered as a solution when beyond these squeezed years during World War Two, other more complex and effective methods are available. From the infrequency of references to the use of bicarbonate of soda for household cleaning, stain removal and gardening I conclude that in British households, bicarb was not often used for a great variety of uses. Where it was used, it was most often in the domain of food provider, health carer, stain removal, rather than general purpose household cleaning.




Between 1940 and 1948 **??** Imperial Chemical Industries placed a series of educational advertisements, called "Services of an Industry", in newspapers to communicate the position of Britain's chemical industry, the ubiquity of chemicals that people relied on everyday, positioning their products in explicitly domestic situations such as the home kitchen, the local shop. Specific advice on the use of chemicals for domestic problems was not given, just the overview that the chemical industry was helping to fight the war with explosives and fire extinguishers, to save people's lives with pharmaceuticals as well as producing all the benign and daily necessities of life. The adverts speak on behalf of the whole British chemical industry in general without mentioning any brand names, though there is the ICI logo and full name at the bottom of each.  That the adverts are given a series name, hinting at other series, and a number in the series, suggests that they might have been intended to appeal to readers to collect them almost like cigarette cards,to hope or to plan to encounter them for a complete experience and greater general knowledge of the British chemical industry. Unlike some adverts disguised as articles about household hints or recipes, such as those placed by the Ministry of Food, there were no textual or graphic instructions to cut out and keep for reference. *Who did they imagine their audience was? Is this a masculine/ feminine divide - collecting and desire for completism is more of a masculine trait?* Trying to reach out to a public audience in this way during a time of potential negativity surrounding shortages of goods, food (fertiliser), the possibility of chemical warfare, news of dumping cheap products on markets with knock-on economic effects, or of the construction of cartels, on the behalf of an entire industry is unique. The name ICI came up often in these stories, being the largest company in Britain active accross the whole spectrum of chemical industries. 

In this series of adverts, ICI products were not marked out as more desirable for any reason, or even that there were particular ICI brands that could be readily found. It was almost communicating that all chemicals are ICI. **??**  Boots ran a series of adverts between 1930 and 1933 promoting their regime of testing and purity, raising the profile of their drug products 



 Oral histories might give me some evidence that people used bicarbonate of soda, as perhaps it was so obvious that people just didn’t need to write it down? 

Motivation
Loblaw, a Canadian firm, repackaged its baking soda as a cleaning product and donated a penny per box of to Friends of the Earth in 1989. This was reported in The Times newspaper, but no other references to businesses operational in the UK doing anything similar appear in the paper. *To be able to say anything more about this requires looking in more detail at the Loblaw package. It could be larger as baking soda typically is not sold in large amounts, the packet could contain more instructions for household uses beyond cooking, or they could have made a completely new package of soda that is aimed solely for cleaning purposes while maintaining a soda for baking offer.*
Special Cases

Fire extinguishers
Fire extinguishers containing bicarb or carbon tetrachloride could be used in a domestic environment, such as a private home, a boat or a car. As the voluntary uptake of extinguishers for domestic use was small, with the users hopefully remaining potential users and not choosing to be repeatedly exposed to the chemical, this use is not one I will dwell upon. However, people's general  understanding about the different uses of these same chemicals might have been augmented by knowing about this use either though exposure at their workplace to fire extinguishers and associated training, or through newspaper reports which mention them. This is especially the case with carbon tetrachloride, which can be lethal if used in a confined space due to its aneasthetic effect, or on hot metal, where it can produce phosgene - a terrifying concept for the proportion of the population who had feared chemical warfare. 

Crack manufacturing
During the mid to late 1980s, newspapers reported on the rise of crack cocaine in the USA and Britain. Some articles went into a surprising amount of detail when discussing the use of bicarbonate of soda in the production of the drug. Although not a regular domestic use, newspapers reported on the topic as if it were something that anybody could do at home, a new incarnation of fascinating experiments with kitchen chemistry. The involvment of a usually quite harmless domestic substance in the homemade conversion of old fashioned (almost familiar, acceptable?) cocaine into a new dangerous form of drug was a compelling story. 

The restriction of sodium bicarbonate because of this use and associated percieved social problems was not raised in the mainstream media or in parliamentary debate. Trying to control this everyday substance would have not only been very difficult to do, but would have caused uproar and ridicule. However, the sale of another domestically used chemical, citric acid, was indeed restricted in 1986 because of its role in heroin injection. Clause 9A was inserted into the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971) which has a section worded "A person who supplies or offers to supply any article which may be used to prepare a controlled drug for administration by any person to himself or another *believing that the article is to be so used* in circumstances where the administration is unlawful is guilty of an offence." Citric acid is not named and to believe that the article is to be so used is actually quite hazy. Could it have been intended to apply to purchases of bicarb? No, this specifies "adminstration of"? However, in clause 4  Restriction of production and supply of controlled drugs.
(1)Subject to any regulations under section 7 of this Act for the time being in force, it shall not be lawful for a person—
(a)to produce a controlled drug; or
(b)to supply or offer to supply a controlled drug to another.
(2)Subject to section 28 of this Act, it is an offence for a person—
(a)to produce a controlled drug in contravention of subsection (1) above; or
(b)to be concerned in the production of such a drug in contravention of that subsection by another.
(3)Subject to section 28 of this Act, it is an offence for a person—
(a)to supply or offer to supply a controlled drug to another in contravention of subsection (1) above; or
(b)to be concerned in the supplying of such a drug to another in contravention of that subsection; or
(c)to be concerned in the making to another in contravention of that subsection of an offer to supply such a drug. - check what the 1980s version of this was, is quite hard to do online with the stupid annotations. 

 However, there was no popular comment on this, leading me to believe that obtaining citric acid had not become more difficult.  this seemd to happen almost under the radar, without much popular comment. **check - don't think have done the times yet?** *also, is there something written about injecting being somehow worse, its association with disease or harder/dirtier drugs?* Domestic users of sodium citrate or citric acid were jam makers and home brewers, both wine and beer, where home brewing enthusiasts could go to specialist shops or mail order for supplies. Sodium citrate was suggested in jam and other domestic recipes as an alternative to fresh lemon juice, demonstrating that it was a good substitute when lemons were scarce during WW2 for instance, but the crystalline chemical was generally unnecessary for most home uses. Perhaps the general silence on this substance becoming controlled in this way was because sodium citrate was a much less commonly used substance, generally obtained from a pharmacy, rather than grocery shelves and therefore not so much in the public eye.
