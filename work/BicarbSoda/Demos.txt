Demos

I agree with the vRant by a chemistry teacher http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mhGQGpFmk4 - chemists are not magicians and seeing something spectacular without understanding the reasons behind it is somewhat pointless. This is something I need to bear in mind if I do any kind of demo. 

Maybe I should think about sticking to compare and contrast type demonstrations - the action of a proprietary cleaner with that of an unbranded chemical, with a good explanation of the mode of action. 

Doing baking soda submarine or volcano demostrations is all very well, but I would have to firmly link it to the chemical mode of action of bicarb as a cleaner. 

Litmus demonstrations, or fire extinguishing demonstrations could be good here. Stain removal is possibly a little bit difficult and uninspiring otherwise. 

Garden chemicals - being explosive isnâ€™t the thing that I should capitalise on an I would not want to have to deal with the risk assessments here at all. Harder to show in real/compressed time how a weedkiller works.
