On February 6 Capt. T. E. Thorpe 
(chairman, Thawpit, Ltd.) said that his 
group bought about 40,000 gross of 
bottles a year. He regarded the asso- 
ciation's agreement as a main defence 
against penetration of the British mar- 
ket by Continental manufacturers. 
Before the association was formed (in 
1935) quality was very poor. Today it 
was excellent. If the agreement came 
to an end, he thought it would result 
in one or two big concerns forming 
some sort of monopoly. The smaller 
manufacturers would disappear. He 
preferred the carriage-paid system 
operated under the agreement. If the 
agreement went, he would order only 
on a day-to-day basis because prices 
would go down. He would not have 
any more long-term contracts. He re- 
garded the association's prices as very 
reasonable. Capt. Thorpe said the agree- 
ment insured price stability. He thought 
a price war would start the day after 
the agreement was removed.

Drugs wall chart 

Cambrian Chemicals Ltd, Beddington 
Farm Road. Croydon, CRO 4XB. have 
available a new 30 X 48in wall chart 
providing a summary of drugs currently 
misused. Risks of abuse, methods of use 
and symptoms of abuse and withdrawal 
are given for twenty-six drugs, which in- 
clude nicotine and alcohol, enabling the 
other dnigs to be related to those which 
are socially accepted. 

Under the risks of abuse section each 
drug is given a numerical rating which 
allows ready comparison of one drug with 
another. Slang terms and physical signs 
of usage are listed, and each drug is classi- 
fied according to the 1971 Misuse of Drugs 
Act. Some interesting statistics about drugs 
are given, and in a definitions section some 
of the terms used on the chart are explain- 
ed. 

The chart is expected to be useful to 
those involved with the drugs problem. In 
two basic colours, with stiffeners and wall 
mounting clips, price £4-90 including 
postage.
