In 1816 the english captain George Manby invented perhaps the first extinguisher, as we know them now. It was to be carried on a hand cart, and consisted of a copper vessel holding 13l of pearl-ash, a chemical used in firefighting since the eighteenth century. The liquid was released by opening a tap, it was pressurized by compressed air.
The 'Fire Annihilator' was patented in 1844 by William Henry Philips in England. After witnessing some volcanic eruptions in Italy, Mr Philips designed the annihilator, which puts the fire out with steam vapor and some other gasses. The construction is quite complicated, but basically chemicals are mixed inside the device, which ignite and cause intense heat, which turns the water inside into steam. This is released trough nozzles on top of the extinguisher. Mr. Philips failed however to convince anyone that it was a working device, especially after a couple of failed demonstrations in the USA, and the destruction of his factory by fire...

Dr François Carlier and A. Vignon apply for a patent in 1866 in Paris for L'Extincteur, an extinguisher based on the soda-acid principle. It was the first time that the necessary pressure to relase the contents, were produced in the extinguisher itself. Basically the reaction between natrium-carbonate and 'tartaric acid' produced a large quantity of CO2 gas, which expelled the contents. This process improved and patented in 1872 by W.B. Dick from Glasgow, who replaced the tartaric acid, by cheaper sulphuric acid.

The 'Harden Number 1 grenade' was patented in 1871 by H.D.Harden of Chicago in the US. It was a glass bottle, filled with a salt-water solution, to be thrown in the base of the fire. Although they had only limited effectiveness, fire grenades would be produced until the 1950's. **From 1877 the Harden grenade was also produced in England, by the Harden Star, Lewis and Sinclair Company Ltd. of Peckham.** Soon a lot of companies in Europe and the US started producing these fire grenades


In the meantime Mr. Schwartz from Bocholt in Germany, developed in 1884 the 'Patent-Handfeuerlöscher', a rectangular formed tin tube. It was filled with an extinguishing powder, probably soda (natriumbicarbonate). The contents had to be thrown with force in the fire, the small opening on the extinguisher, adding to the speed of the powder. Soon these extinguishers were produced worldwide, in the form of tubular tin tubes or cardboard containers. Early models were the 'Firecide' (US) or **Kyl Fire (England). These would also be produced well into the 1920's and '30s**.

1912 Saw the first model of the Pyrene CTC hand-pump fire extinguisher. Carbon tetrachloride (CCI4) was a very effective agent against petrol fires, and fires under high voltage, such as electricity stations as it was non conductor up to 150.000 volts. The only and most important disadvantage was that, when in contact with high temperature, the CTC produced the lethal phosgene gas, which could lead to death when used in confines paces. Germany ordered a law in 1923 to reduce the size of tetra-extinguishers to max 2 liters, to reduce the amount of lethal gas produced.

1 quart capacity "special liquid"
non conductive, non freezing, safe to use on high voltage fires, will not freeze unless temp below -4 F
easily refilled, frequently fires extinguished with only two ro three pumps.  The remaining liquid is good for further use, but for safety's sake the extinguisher should be topped up to the proper level immediately after use.

Note - these extinguishers should not be used in confined spaces, a high concentration of the vapour is liable to be dangerous. Ventilate after use.

The Pyrene Mfg. Co. was started in 1907 in New York, and would produce CTC hand pump extinguishers, and a wide range of others, well into the 1960's. This compact extinguisher proved to be very effective, and due to the increasing automobiles and inherent petrol fires, Pyrene gained a leading position in the CTC extinguisher market. 
Very soon CTC was used worldwide by numerous companies, it was also used as contents for the glass fire grenades to improve their performance. Manufacturers like Red Comet, Autofyre or Pakar (BE) would sell these until the 50's. Also larger extinguishers were produced, for CTC mostly one gallon types.

In 1938 Minimax, Hoechst and Junkers developed in Germany a less poisonous variant of this agent, CB or chlorobromemethane. Most extinguishers would now be filled with this agent, until the invention of Halon in the 1960's. This was a inert an non-poisonous gas, with very good extinguishing results. Halon is today also forbidden, because of it's destructiveness of the Ozon-layer.

Dry Powder as a chemical extinguishing agent, was already used from the 1850's. Mostly solutions and mixes of **sodium-bicarbonate** or ashes would be used in cardboard or tin tubes. 
In 1912 Total in Berlin, applied for a patent for a CO2 based powder extinguisher. The CO2 was stored in an external bottle, as with the water extinguishers, and a water-resistant powder would be contained in the extinguisher. At first the effectiveness of this extinguisher was attributed to the CO2, only later the powders were further improved.

Fire extinguishing powder would become the most used and most effective of all extinguishers. Designs changed during the years with the addition of hose and nozzles, improvements to the powder itself and the ability to store it in large volumes. In 1955 a powder was produced that could also tackle fires of the 'A' class, being solid fuel like wood etc.

**The Antifyre Ltd. company from Middlesex, produced in the 30's a fire gun, based on powder cartridges. The cartridges contained an extinguishing powder, and a small explosive charge, like a bullet. By aiming at the fire, striking the lever and firing, the fire would instantly be extinguished. Antifyre also offered free refills when used against fire.** Several small and large models were produced, mostly delivered with a wall hanger and several recharges, or contained in a metal box.
Several other manufacturers produced a similar device, some also filled with tetra or CBF charges. Neant Feu from France produced a wooden pistol with a removable CBF charge, contained in a glass or metal cartridge.

The Minimax Apparate Bau Gesellschaft was founded 1901 in Berlin by Wilhelm Graaff. He worked as a salesman for a french extinguisher company, and noticed the flaws and disadvantages of these extinguishers, and decided to invent his own.
Together with Ing. Hans Mikorey they applied for a patent for a conical soda-acid fire extinguisher in december 1902.

The 'Spitztüte' as it was soon named, was model of steel plates, leaded against corrosion. A small bottle containing sulphuric acid, was help in a cage, this was broken by the plunger when knocked on the floor. The extinguisher itself was filled with a water and 'soda' solution. The acid reacted with the soda in the water and produced instantaneously CO2 gas, forcing the fluid out of the body. This pressure gave the extinguisher a stream of 12m far or 8m high, and the chemical reaction released also about 60l of CO2 gas.
The simple design and effectiveness made this extinguisher an instant success. After only one year, already 50.000 were produced in the small factory in Berlin. 
The name of the extinguisher itself was found by a contest between employees : Minimax, a Minimum of effort and weight, a Maximum of efficiency..

Wilhelm Graaff very soon realized, that the most import thing in fire prevention was self-preservation and quick response. He was convinced that small fire extinguishers could save hundreds of lives, and thousands of properties each year, this became his campaign to sell Minimax extinguishers. 

Soon local authorities and the fire departments recognized and approved the Minimax idea, and thousands of extinguishers were sold to rural communities. Shops, small fire brigades and individuals were issued with Minimax extinguishers, got an sign on the outside of the houses, and maps were drawn and displayed. When a fire broke out in a rural village, locals could try to fight it, before the fire brigades arrived.. a unique and valued system.

Minimax applied also a very clever 'feedback' system. Every extinguisher which was emptied during outbreak of a fire, was refilled for free. In return the customer testimonials were systematically collected in the offices in Berlin. This led to thousands of records during the first decade, giving the company a thankful advertising tool. This technique was also used in the other European Minimax offices...

Training and research was also viewed by Wilhelm Graaff as very important, and already in 1903 an in-house magazine was published (in 5 languages!), which contained technical and sales information. The research led to the development of a wide product range, and numerous new patents for improvements on fire extinguishers and extinguishing techniques.

letter dated 1929 - Minimax ltd Feltham Middx. 

Already in the first years offices were opened, and sister companies founded in the United Kingdom, Austria, Belgium, France, Hungary, Italy and New York. By 1914 Minimax was exporting it's extinguishers worldwide as far as Africa, India, China, the US or Australia...

**The first extinguishers containing CTC (carbon tetrachloride) were produced by 1912, providing an effective agent against petrol or flammable liquid fires.** Also the conical extinguishers, known as types A,B or G were further improved and available as different versions. The larger B models were equipped with a nozzle, which could be shut, and leather straps, so it could be carried on the back. This would prove to be the popular model MF10 for fire brigades, motorized fire fighters or forest fires.. These models were also available in a more luxurious version, either in brass with according chromed bracket, or a more subtle white paint for homes or hospitals.
**CTC models were produced in sizes varying from 2 to 6l, the pressure was generated by a capsule containing soda and acid. The CTC agent was also very effective against high voltages, being nonconductor up to 150.000 Volts.**

The economic crisis of the early 30's, dealt also a great blow to the company. People had to be fired, the headquarters were moved from the expensive prime location, sister companies abroad were merged and the range of extinguishers was shrinked. 
The buid-up to WW2 and the improving economic climate gave the company a new impulse. Thousands of extinguishers were made for the army, new types could be developed. 
WW2 led to shortages in materials and workforce. Slave laborers and prisoners were employed in the factory in Neuruppin, the production also included war supplies and flamethrowers. **At the same time Minimax Ltd. in Feltham, England was producing a variant of the conical extinguisher which could be used against incendiary bombardments.. In Berlin the headquarters and all archives will be lost due to bombardments.**
The end of the war, meant the loss of the undamaged works in Neuruppin to the Russian occupying forces and the loss of all the sister companies abroad. The factory would later be used by an east-german company, who still produced extinguishers in the Neuruppin site until the 1990's.
From 1947 on extinguishers were once again produced by the Minimax AG, based in Stuttgart. Later the company moved to new modern premises in Bad Urach. 
The 50's saw further development of extinguisher and agents (dry powder Multi-troxin for classes AB and C fires) and a further expansion in fixed installations on ships, sprinkler systems and fire fighting vehicles.

Today Minimax & Co GmbH is market leader for fire protection in Germany, about 350.000 extinguishers a year leave the factory..
