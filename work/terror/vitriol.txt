loss of face - vitriol throwing  in 19th and 20th Century Britain Cassie Watson
27 March 2013


assault prosecutions - not homicide, rape etc - women’s use of violence was different
intentionally disfiguring - unknown in uk before 180s - died out in late 20th C, became better known as

vitriol
cleaning copper pots - vitriol
agricultural and manufacturing

well featured in novels and other literature
chemical burns
Grahame Green - woman disfigured by a  man
French female crime wave - greater leniency for women, vitrioleuse often acquitted

english jury not swayed by emotion
violence and class - working class, not a crime of passion but a n innate desire to cause pain
upper class - pushed beyond the limits, can take no more

crimes of passion - few middle and upper class

acceptance of notion that intimate violence was excusable or legitimate
oil of vitriol strong sulphuric acid - cheap common, corrosive

sexual jealousy - clear link, valueless. usually carried out in public space - symbolic
other motivation and context - industrial disputes, animal cruelty (infrequent) Irish nationalists rhetorical form of violence, threat to throw vitriol became a crime, never collective action - only between two people

how did juries react to crime of passion? malice and forethought? 

old bailey trials
law reports
medical texts urban phenomena
  few cases in Wales, but reported in Eg, Scot, Ireland
  
  111 cases 1820 − 1913 old bailey
  
  rare
  
  
  England - damage to property - clothes
  person - not a wound wording could only be incision - so not biting, beating etc (1861 offences against the person ) (poisoning was an offence, as was stabbing)  1803
  
  no offence committed if no intent - accidentally thrown on victim. 
  few deaths - exceptional - medical complications
  

oxalic, ammonia, carbolic still thrown but less extreme

murder never stated as intent , always to main or thrown in a fit of anger and madness- always head neck upper body, into face - deeply personal (though also used by robbers to incapacitate)

Joh Glaisyer - Quaker - animal cruelty but probably directed at the dog owner

clusters of mysterious attacks on ladies dresses
e.g. Theodore grey US could not say why he committed attacks
vitriol pest 500 victims in paris, most wearing fur coats in specific part of city and time of day

little speculation on why in UK press
sadism symbolic sadism , fetishism, Kraft Ebing - sexual deviant
industrial - small mob or group on one person (Started on looms, fabric, machinery - luddite, then factory owners

generally young perps, old enough to know what doing
mostly working class -labourers, prostitutes, servants - jury still lenient in UK harsh sentence for those w hist of violence, unprovoked


love rivals attacked got harsher sentences

1967 Feb 1968 sentenced Marjorie Cutts (victim) nitric acid Reginald Everest

1933 - pharmacy and poisons act had impacted this by preventing strong sulphuric being sold

motivated by own loss of face, shame, threatened position in community
use by women declined compared to use by men
shame punishment carried out by the individual, doubly stigmatised
life changing for victims - financial, social, esteem, employment, loss of respect

 victims and perps general poor and didn’t leave records
 workhouse
 retraining through charity
 hist of disability disfigurement unknown
 
 much less frequent after WW2
 included in film guideline for deletion 1933
 1 per month in Edwardian times
 
 national archives - sulphuric acid not used so much 
 cheap and easy to obtain - rising in Bangladesh, tendency to copycat
 
 katie piper victim 2008
 today is always male
 more gratifying to hurt reputation rather than physicality

battery acid, undiluted
make a a spectacle
attitudes to women, respect lack of 
100/yr reported in Pakistan


**accessilbility - any oil shop or chemist shop, in large quantities, bring own cup
immediate use, throw straight out of cup**    
could only do it when shops were open 
what about using it at home - still a cup?
this would eventually be restricted by having to use a proper container.

transportation  

poisoner has to plan more carefully
	rarely seen to be crime of passion - clearly planned to kill someone, not just ill, incapacitated


no moral panic about vitriol pests in uk

not muscle powered - children, women? 
such a powerful acid with hideous , concious seek attacks

not unconcious - petrol often deployed when asleep
generally in public, or on doorstep

pest behaviour became passe in UK earlier than England, English psychologists not interested in sexology until later
