p4  “Remember: do not bite off more than you can chew, and if there is any risk at all
p5 that the stain is larger than you can handle or that its removal is at all tricky, call in a professional at once: it is not faire to him to expect him to cope with your initial mistakes as well as the original stain.  [ don’t make **him** deal with **your** mistakes - generic he? Is it just because I’m sensitive in 2013 to gendered language?]

Especially you should avoid what I might call ‘old wives recipes’ ... many of them have snags, especially making the stain worse. The sort of thing I mean is where you are advised to ‘Cover with salt, pour on lemon juice and rub with half a tomato’ or something like that!”

Haven’t seen a discussion before about how the stains actually get removed before, but this little book describes some ways that tain removal works.
p6
three main methods of stain ‘removal’. These act by : 
<li>Dissolving the staining agent and so enabling it to be washed out.</li>
<li>Bleaching the staining agent; but remember that you may bleach the fabric too.</li>
<li> Loosening the staining agent and carrying it off in small solid particules even though it doesn’ actually dissolve it</li>

stressed removal of dissovld stain, or flushing away with excess remover 

p7 IMPORTANT WARNING!
Remvember that propreitory cleaning solvents are chemicals and sometimes dangerous ones. In the hands of children or careless adults they could be responsible for another of the many accidents which occur in the home continually. (Did you know that *more accidnets take place in the home each day that on the roads?* [this is actually total accidents, mostly trips and falls, comparatively few chemical accidnets] [interesting that it chooses children and careless adults]

All household chemicals should be kept of of reach of childen but grease removers, for (p8) instance are highly volatile. Used away from naked flames and only in well ventialted rooms. [does not say no smoking]  do not stand the bottle w/o its stopper where it can be knocked over - this is easy to do especially if you are in a hurry as you may well be when trying to remove stain. 
Children are often attracted by the smell of these fluids (mine were!) and will sniff them accidentally or deliverately or even perhaps addictedly. They will probably not like to tell you about this occasional excitemnet, which is really dangerous and should be discourages as stongly as possible. 
In addition to the danger of vapour from psc there are a number of ‘natural’ cleaning agents which are in themselves highly poisonous. I have seen ‘salts of lemon’ recommended for removing stains without mentioning that it is a deadly poison also. Even when ammonia is recommended in the terms ‘ a teaspoonful in a pint of water’ you have (p9) initally strong ammonia in a bottle which can seriously damage a child’s eyes and nose if inquisitively sniffed. 
Don’t ever be misled into thinking that because you have had a bottle of this or that around the kitchen for ages w/o any accidents these cannot happen, and when they do it may be too late. So, for safety-first, keep all chemicals well out of reach. 

[harming childrens eyes, not own eyes. Do people without children not need to worry about dangers to themselves? Interesting. Leslie probably has children so always thinks in terms of children]
[‘natural’ in reference to salts of lemon - I haven’t seen sol be called natural yet, and I think I’ve usually seen it referred to as generically poisonous]

DISCLAIMER responsibility for any damage incurred through the use of this booklet rests with the user. [and to be fair, she does quite often recommend going straight to a professional esp with ink

p11 types of fabric listed fit well with the time
‘rich fabrics’ brocades, lame, metallic fibres and also fury fabrics such as velvet, camel hair, reps, vicuna and imitation furs, velour, mohair and so on, as well as the delivate natural and man-made forms of cashmere chiffon georgette, silks, tafetts, satins. Heavy materials also need special care, such as cords, drill, gaberdine, boradcloth and many forms of mens and womens suitings and overcoat materials. Watch also waterproof and flameproof materials. 

p14 Carpet care - most likely to be things spilt or dropped on carpets, or from the ravages of small children, or dogs, not to mention heavy footmarks of husbands. 
... number of silmple to use carpet shampoos. Get a recommendation from carpet maker. 
p15 [re carpet maker] He knows best.   [possibly just a generic he, mankind, or is it really he? Gender neutral matters more now?]
.....
watch small children therefore and pick up food fragments before they [get trodden in] and become  for removal.   [because adults never drop food?]


Stains to remove - tells us about what is happening? I think so. 
Alcohol - see also beer and wines: [should also say Stout, as that is a separate entry too, whisky refers to wine, sherry has own entry, no gin here (I can’t believe gin stains anyway)]

photographic chemicals - “These vary so much and may be so complex that removal could be difficult if they will not launder out. But so many do stain, and photographers will use handkerchiefs and towels! Try to avoid rather than remove later. Also keep all utensils and sinks etc, clean. Easy to pick up later in eg teatowels and hypo in the sink will turn silver black.”  [silver cutlery?]

Hobbies - (not listed as hobbies but def identifiable)
balsa cement, contact adhesive,  glue, plasticine, fibre tip pen ink, ink, enamel paint, paste, crude oil, photographers chemicals, grass stains (flannels - sports specifc, or fabric type?), oil (refers to bicycle)

Office / work encounters?
Carbon paper (tricky - meths not psc), rubber stamp ink, ink, sealing wax?, ball point pen ink, emulsion paint, photographic chems

Crude oil gets its own entry, and the way that it is written suggests that this is crude oil encountered on beaches, after an oil spill somewhere
“Try lard (or even butter) especially for aniamls’ paws. A good psc is ‘Spot’ made by Lane & Stedman, West St, Brighton for tar and crude oil only. Bad cases (eg seabirds) take to vet.”

refers to Which? magazine to get details of comprehensive tests on a large number of prop cleaning agents with a great range of stains and has published the findings in tabular form. If you subscribe to Which you will be able to consider their experience.
[which could also be read at libraries? suppose they want to say that its perhaps not found on the newsagents shelf, but mailed out to subcribers - find this out.]
