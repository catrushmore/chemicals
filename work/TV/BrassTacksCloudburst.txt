Since Bhopal, chem ind have become associated with a new order of terror. However, new legislation has been introduced in this country which id designed to make chemical companies demonsrate the effectiveness of their safety procedures. Does this mean were safe? Brass Taks put the question to Stephen Grant, a former H&S Director for Scotland, who seemd to think it was as much a matter of luck as judgement. “I think the chemical industry’s trac record is very good, and that is due to a combination of carful management and to som extent, good fortune. A lot of things go wrong of course, but they don’t alwyas cause diasters. Now when you get, for example, a large loss of liquified petroleum gas, what you’re doing then is keeping your fingers crossed that it doesn’t ignite and it can disperse without ignighting. That happens. We’ve lost large tonnages of flammable vapour without it igniting. W’ve also had some toxic releases, but we’ve never had a major one. If you did get a really major one, you’d keep your finders crossed as to which way the wind is bloiwn. That is, it could go one way, down, say, a river esturary adn you could get away with it completely. But if the wind happens to be in a different direction, you could have a potential Bhopal on your hands.”
