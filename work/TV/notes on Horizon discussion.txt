I would like to point out though is that having this tool, this developing tool from the chemical industry requires a much greater sense of responsibility on the part of everyone, managers operatives and the public. We haven't got that et. I don't like the idea of nineteen million gardeners and three hundred thousand farmers all with a potential finger on the trigger, it doesn't sound sense to me. So that if we talk of speicificity, I would like to talk in a ? of licenced operatives people who have been skilled, trained in the use of these things. 


Rothschild : Well Smith there's something you said which rather worries me. You said a moment ago, why don't we concentrate on England. Now you're an eminent scientist and you therefore have an international attitude. And I think we should not condiser theses problems from the pint of England we should consider them on a world basis. I don't feel in this world of sciece or ecology that you could restrict yourself to a small country where fortunately we have very little insect borne disease and no starvation. 
England where there isn't famine or insect borne disease - vs world view

Boote - the point though about the overseas and underdeveloped countires is surely that there we've got to bring them much more than chemicals, we've got to give the knowledge, of modern techniques in husbandry, we've got to show them all the alternatives. Nearly all the sparys invariabley kill of birds which eat insect shus creating - thus paving the way for future plagues. You can't carry on indefinitely slaughtering things.

speicific insectivcies - magic bullet which would kill just the pests. Edson was arguing that this was all very well, but since there were hundreds of pests you'd have hundreds of different specific insectiicdes and one can quite visualise both the expense and the muddle and this would create..
