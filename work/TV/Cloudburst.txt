Tony Barrell. HSE sitting at desk. responding to prev statemtne
Anything is credible, some things are extraordinarily unlikely. 

I don't think they are only planning for a 20ton release. They do not accept catastropice failure is credible. 

I think they should This is the sort of the thing that will form part of that dialogue. Anxious that people do consider these remote events. 

Are you tellig me you are not satisfie with the level of their planning?
No, I'm not saying that, I don't know that they aren't planning for this. I'd be very surprised if they weren't taking into account the failyre of

Doesn't mean that it can't happen tomorrow. 

ICI keep coming back to the years... and the catastropihic failure of the storage tank. 
Safety case is to set a framework - sounds like different ideas. If we persuade them that there is no danger, there is no need for us to plan. 
We've considered them in order to reject the possibility.

Douglas Pickett
Live ear a storage tank 50 tons of cl - firm doesn't have to inform residents of what to do in an emergency. This I feel its wrong, no matter how much chlorine is on site residents should know what to do in an emergency. Just because there's less than 50 tons doesn't mean that its quite safe and I feel very strongly about this. Grimsby. 

John Davies Oswestry
I've been in the chem ind all my working life and I know what, precautions we take when working with hazardous materials on site. There are some 328 000 in the industry,  some of us living close to our place of work so we'll be the first to be affected if something goes seriously wrong at work. And when we leave work we want to get home safe and sound and we want to find our families safe and sound when we get there.  In the history of the chemical industry, we have never killed a member of the public by operating chemical plant in the UK. 

DAvid Sealey   Belper
I live near an oil refinery on March 3rd 1986 there was an explosion followed by a fire, explosion, closing of roads, evacuation of staff. Wrote to HSE to discover why fire, what steps to prevent fire occuring again. SEemed particularly impt as f or many years had been told that the possility of this occuring was neglibilr. Feel extreme anger that this event took place and frustration that no progress can be made in ameliorating the effects made by the plant on the area.

John Porrit. Director FoeHow do you argue with someone here in an area like EP where unemp is so high that safety comes second?- 
Always been tradeoffs between the benefits that come from industry and the risks that one incurrs and what I feel is quite here is that some of those tradeoffs have been made unwisely and that the environment, the physical and the human environment has suffered too much as a consequence of that...  What we're seeing now 're getting the tradeoffs better adujusted, we  can see the risks for what they really are.And make ecisions accordingy.
as

Always as an advanced industrial society goign to have to take decisions like that, env movement - that unless it can be proved categorically to be acceptable that we should not proceed and should find alternative ways of creating jobs. 

Stop digging peat on Islay. 
This is what happens when people get their facts twisted. Those who said there was threat to jobs were lying Those who said there was threat to  economy were lying. The issue was an important one. There would be more work created there than less. Brings us back to the cruscial point of information and using the information to arrive at the right decision. 

Isn't being on the dole unhealthy?
 being on the dole is of course is unhealthy, but dying of some particularly nasty form of pollution or having ones health severely affected by exposeure to toxic materials is much more unhealthy than that.

 We don't we masks outside the factory, that's what we're complaining about. 
 Were you reassured by your trip? No. 

It should be investigated for the Next generation, children not born yet. We don't know that consitsts of this whatever it is. 

Martin Trowbridge
Isn't it symptomatic of how much industry has lost public confidence?
Our industry needs to work hard to retain  public confidence and indeed build it up. On of the problems we suffer in the industry is peoples general ignorance of what the chemical industry does and that's largely our own problem and why in the last two or tree years we've benn making efforts to interest people in what the industry does and how we handle hazards safely and in that sense I ahve to say that we very much welcome the regualtions to inform people. I would say inform people as much as they can possibly take in. 

Shouting over concept of fear - don't think they were frightened, they were talking about amenities... (they were frightened)
chem mfc - soc cannot exist without chem mfcr. 
People would rather chem industries went somewhere else. (does not say NIMBY)
keep doing it, keep going on reassuring them. Taking them round the factory is an excellent thing to do. Havin g and open door day next september. As an industry we have nothing at all to be ashamed of. 

Contraty to popular belif Grimsby doesn't smell of fish, it smells of chemicals. Daughter sent home from school with a note to keep an eye on her as a yellow substance invaded the premises. She was sick twice that night. She seems fine now but I don't know what it was as  noone will admit it was their chem. I worry about her future life. And due to this I want to move to the country where I believe both my children will be able to grwo up healthy. 

Everyday we make use of proucts of the chemical industry. We choose to do this, noone forces us to do this, but if we do we have to accept the risk thats assoc with their mfc. We have to ask the question then whether the benefits outwight the residual risk. I do. without a chem indu, no suft furnishings, no aircarft, no cars, no complex operations as there would be no safe aneasthetics available and no safe drinking water. 


Startling clarity - enourmous gulf between two sides, can it be gridged. 

All arranged like have I got news for you etc. 
John Porrit and Dave Gee, from GMB union

recognsie that being in business of hazrdous industry not just serving shareholders also protect interest of local communities. Want action not pious words. One particular initiative - provide peopel with the information that they need so theyre fully informed. Appalling record. Keep things secret wherever possible. HSE aren't pushing interest hard enough. 
Mr Trowbridge - didn't think there was much of a gulf. Beginging to reveal the matter of the gulf which is the perception of facts. The undsutry are very anxious to give you facts, leaving aside trade secrets, those are problems exporting overseas your knowhow unpaid, tell the public as much as you possibly can. 
doesn't accord with what Porrit says or 1/3rd viewers who phoned worried about plant at the bottom of their garden When they rang them all they got was a smooth pr man

Not get the info that they would like to hear such as there is a serious problem when there is no serious problem. Companies convey what is needed under new regulations. Must go out more and more and tell people what is happening. 

Let us have support for getting information which is not under trade secrets, which is published, out there and known. 
Views of risk sand state of plants - not trade secrets info given to workers and should be given to commnity as well. 

Given to people in the workplace and they are in the position to make a judgement. 
What was said earlier about bribing  people with jobs (??) 
1) common interest in sucess of the enterprise
2) understand the technology involved. 
Educate the public a lot more before they are able to make those complicate judgements. 

Phil Ward
Work in chem ind
common sense and complacency are 

has brains and common sense to do more - people can be made more aware 

Trowbridge - last 10yrs HSE in the workplace
balance has been made - interest in the enterprises, common understanding of the words using, 
Entering decade or 20yrs of envir - have to evelop same language and perception. Find areas where we're not in disagreement. Then find out why we are in disagreement. 

Does that mena anything to you? No abosultel not. That's not what we're talking about. 
Establishign a framework in which to make decision. Gives me nothing to hope for pious rhetoric that youve said for years. 

Peter Bone
no point in creating barriers. 
Orocess are risky, natural concern, esp people who live close to chem plants. 
Environmentalists have got to acknowele that industry is not totally negative to env, safty problems, not toally profit orientate, does put safety amonght highest priorities. Must build diagloue that each sie recognises the problems. 

Credilbity gap exists - not helped by the publicity that appears on the chemical side, much more than it is not helped by that which appears on the envi side. What credibility do you have with the general public. Sellafield - major newspaper asked rep cross section of readers about whether thay believed BNFL or FoE on 10 std questions, 95% FoE. Don't want to close down chem indu in this country. Believe in tradeoffs. 

People living near chem industy are the people we have to convince. 

I wouldn't live down wind of a chlorine plant, within 5miles. 
I hae no more worries following that programe last week. 

In general they are not telling the truth - just simple things like having a good safety records. Killed 17 of our memebers from a substance. No studies into ill health. Do not know what hemicals are doing. Turned down our proposal. HSE figures. 

Testig materials - spending publics money, it is the people who consume the chemicals who will pay for all this, on searching for a needle which may or may not excist in a haystack which we don't know wher it is, really quite impractical.

Clearly a shift in the balance of power between industry and environmentalist. Are you worried that your inutry will face greater restricitions? 
That's looking at it from the negative point of view. Positive contine to work hard, dismissed as PR to inform public to interest the public, to make them relaise what we're doing for society and they should listen to what we say. Work with haz mat but in a safe way. A much much increased education movement. 

public money - 
Beneefits to chem ind are privatised -remain within the industry, many of the  costs in producing chemicals are spread thorughout society, community and env pick up the costs. Cost internatlised, put to dealing with thos eproblems. Takign a responsible part of society. 

(Discussion would liek to go on. )
Discussion is only just starting. 
At the next gen election will be tinged with more than a hint of gren.
