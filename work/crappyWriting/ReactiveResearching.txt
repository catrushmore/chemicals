Reactive Researching

When I started this project, I had a plan of areas to research and how they might be or are linked. I periodcally rewrite this when it bores me or I feel stuck, or lost in an avenue of unproductive searching. 

Reactive researching is when I respond to calls for conference papers. I so far haven’t submitted a paper, but I do find the notices really useful pulling together strands of existing research. How can I re-package or repurpose my existing research for this audience? I think this is because I got used to working to deadlines and projects for particular purposes. The PhD project is longer and doesn’ have the same kinds of consequences for not hitting personally imposed deadlines. Obviously not getting the PhD is a big consequence, but its further away, less immediate. 

Conference papers, even though I’m only pretending, are a big help in getting me writing. Usually, they ask for around 500 words which is quite achieveable. Unless I really get into it and think “yes, this is an amazing jewel of a draft and I must polish it up to 500 words of sparkling coherence and structuarlly perfect product to hand in” I’m really just treating the conference theme as a topic to write around for half an hour or so to get down some thoughts and perhaps instructions to research in certain directions.
