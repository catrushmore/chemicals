Modernity

Have I encountered any discourse on modernity per se? I don’t think I have yet, but I would like and ought to. 

The use of branded or preprepared chemical mixtures is, I think, definitely a sign of modernity, modern housewifery, modern gardening techniques and modern hobbies. Domestic modernity in my time period is likely to concern appliances, new materials, new activities, loss of servants, more outside the home working, changed values of cleanliness, changed sites of toilet (entering the living space). Home economics and trying to improve the efficiency or to apply science to housewifery is an attempt to modernise the work. However, I have not really found anything that mentions chemical products that much in the housewifery manuals or guides. 

On packaging and in advertising, either modern slickness or traditional (non modern) values are communicated graphically, through bright or homely artwork. I think this is really interesting, but I’m going to have to really gem up on visual culture stuff. This let me down in my MSc project too. 

Concerns about environmental stewardship are modern, even if using chemicals for various jobs and the threat to individual users or groups of humans exposed nearby are not modern, which is interesting. 

Organic gardening is an interesting version of modern because of the way it was taken up as a reaction to or against the modern chemical methods. Yet the way it was implemented and communicated was quite modern, with applied scientific studies and investigations by organisations to modernise the practices, to put some evidence behind their methods and claims. 

Perhaps **evidence** is a key marker of modernity? Proof, comparisons, that can be seen with a consumers own eyes, experienced for themselves through touch taste or smell, is important in choosing products that are shown to be effective, value for money. Which? publications might be a good example of modern consumer guidance. Testimonials are not enough, these are tied to patent medicines and other preparations, now we want scientists, lab coats and glasses to demonstrate the effectiveness or safety of products. Saying that, safety is usually denoted by children and pets playing (almost the opposite of the scientist in protective equipment) on or near the surface that has recently had the chemical applied to it. Regarding testimonials, they are still important (look at all the products that can be and are reviewed in depth) consumers probably want some way of identifying that the testimonial or review is related to their situation and that the writer of the review has applied themselves in a reasonably expert way to the situation (they have experience of other products that this can be compared to, or they can imagine ways of making the experience better if it needed improvment). 

I should

 - find out what the proper historical/ academic definition of modernity is, because I might just be making up my own version. 
 - find, read and digest the key papers in this area - they might even look at the use of branded products, especially perhaps with respect to convenience or consumer choice, modernity has probably been well covered in advertising. If it hasn’t, I bagsy it!
 - write some literature review
 - which can morph into or form the basis of the conference paper - 20 minutes isn’t long. 
 - Send it to Viviane and /or Glen for writing practice review/ discussion for next supervision meeting
