Today
I went to Reading Local Studies Centre, which is in the central or main library. I’ve never seen a library so full of people. The librarian was helpful, though worryingly said that it was perhaps too large an area. I had said I was looking for evidence of chemical sales in Reading. I’d looked online at their achived photos of streetscenes, because sometimes the chemist shops in particular, though probably others like hardware shops, ironmongers and grocers, display statements and adverts about the goods sold inside. Even though this isn’t the full picture, I felt like trying to make a start on this would be worth my while, seeing as I haven’t made any real progress for some time now. 

The librarian suggested, in response to my being unable to narrow down the thousands of digitised picture, that I could look at the directories for the area. I had forgotten about directories, I used to love going through them, I still do, but it just hadn’t occured to me to hunt them down in the Bodleian (like anything else printed in Britain, they’ll have a copy) and go through it. 

I hunkered down with a directory for Reading and one for the wider area, covering Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire. There was only a year’s difference in them, but the larger earlier one had slightly more detailed information which was useful to me. I trawled alphabetically through the trades, incase there were things I hadn’t thought of but generally the chemists and druggists, drug stores, hardware shops, ironmongers and photographic dealers had everything covered. Though I need to find out what the difference is between a druggist, a drug store and a chemist. Sometimes names changed - in 1932 Reading taxidermists was a sensible term but in the larger directory of 1931 it was “see animal and bird preservers”. I only looked at taxidermists because I figured that that they would need supplies of chemicals, rather than they had any crossover to domestic uses. Another thing to find out is what is an oil and color merchant? Why was Boots a “cash chemist” in Reading 1932, but not listed as such in Oxford 1931? Pharmaceutical chemists were asterisked, Manufacturing chemists usually had a separate entry, as did wholesale chemists.  

This was interesting because seeing how much space the premises occupied indicates something of the shops size and perhaps prestige or popularity, depending on the street address. and perhaps liklihood of turning up in the photos. Bigger isn’t always better, but I do need some parameters in this study. 

The Berkshire or Oxfordshire record office would hold any sales ledgers and other material that was kept for archiving for the companies in question, and I’ve already contacted Oxford History Centre to see what they have (not all that much, which is probably helpful, again narrowing down) but I hadn’t thought of looking at the directories to see how many shop premises there were.

The number of chemists and druggists listed in Reading (thought it would be polite to focus on the city while I’m here) was 29, more if you looked into it and found there were multiple premises or branches. Of these, I have marked 10 as also being named in the directory as also a photographic supplier. This works out as 34% being listed, at least in 1931. That is interesting to me, because I hadn’t known that not all chemists would or would not stock this niche of products, and wanted to be listed as reasonably expert (perhaps) in that. I can also use this kind of information to see how it changes over time - will it increase, decrease (I expect so) and will other more specialist shops fill this gap (not sure, probably). There are probably good studies of what strategies the chemists used in deciding to stock such things, for instance being a one stop shop for Kodak products. The National Media Museum might have something on this even. 

Also of note were the times that telephone numbers were listed (very few!)  and when sex signifiers were used. I don’t think I encountered any first names that might suggest the chemists shops were women, though this was of note when they were photographers or taxidermists, hardware and ironmongers propetiors. 

When I idled accross “Manure merchants” there was a distinction between agricultural (1/4) and chemical(1/4), as well as not specified (2/4).
Lime Merchant is probably not suitable for domestic use, and appears hard to get hold of “letters through Theale”. 

Oil and colour merchant - paint seller
	maybe try to find more about the Mays and Mackays Limited - oils paints and chemicals, depot for Hall’s santiary washable distempter.
	[Advantages: It set Hard, Kills Vermin, and Disinfects\ it is made in Dark Rich Shades as well as in Light Tints **contains no Lead** and **Does Not Turn Black**\ It only requires the addition of Water to make it ready for use so that anybody can supply it.|]
