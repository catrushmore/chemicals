Incredible Shrinking Woman

Shrink population, not only to rule over it, but also to deal with resource shortages, which is a nod to many other science fiction films of the 1950s.


If Dr Strangelove can be considered worthy of study for nuclear fear, then I can consider ISW in respect to consumer/domestic chemicals. This is where I need to focus on, rather than science fiction, because it is not respected as true science fiction (neither was the original). What is important is the cynicism as described by Giddens, “a mode of dampening the emotional impact of anxieties through a humorous or world weary response to them. It lends itself to parody and in many forms of black humour. ... Can co-exist with a kind of desperate hopefulness.” (p136) This is what I think ISW does - it looks at the consumer society, the plethora of unknown chemicals and brands that we place faith in without really knowing what their interactions and consequences might be. It even includes the character who becomes a consumer activist, taking the stance that Giddens describes as radical engagement - an attitude of practical contesteation towards perceived sources of danger.  ?
