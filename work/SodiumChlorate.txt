Sodium chlorate will make a good candidate for a study of a domestic chemical. 

It was used as weedkiller. It is currently (2009) withdrawn from sale because it needs to be assessed for safety. 

It is explosive and has been written on in an agricultural context by James Watson. 

It will probably appear in a history of the NI Troubles, as it was used in explosives as commercial Semtex, gelignite became harder to get/ make it go further. Because of this, it appears in Hansards in some debates about control of, and manufacturing of sodium chlorate being based in this country would be affected if sales were severely restricted. 

It was used in home made bombs and fireworks, contributing to the recomendations by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Explosives that science teachers leave out this information from their classes. This would be intersting to folow up, as the weedkiller would have been pretty easy to get hold of.

It might not have been branded with obfuscatory names, but there have been a lot of different packages of it, under brand names. Check to see what the names were - did they include sodium chlorate? 

Powder seems to have been the principle way it was bought with periodic interest from MPs about whether a form could be produced that would not work as an explosive, or whether a liquid form would be effective as a weedkiller - concentration was generally listed as the issue here, though I don’t see how that should matter.
