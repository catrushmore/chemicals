ready prep chems of the finest quality are available to suit almost every conceivable purpose int eh practice of photography, there are many amateur photos who prefer to make up their own sons, either from a point of view of interest or for reasons of economy. 

how to store chemicals
chemicals should not be purchased in too small quantities, smaller quantities are proportionally dearer than larger
suitable storage  0dangers of storing chems in paper bags, still worse in a damp darkroom
each bottle must be adequately labelled so that one does not have to rely on memory (no indication here of other people mistaking your bottles, or what adequately labelled might be)

At the back of the book is a section called 
Dark-room Hints - p48
which contains antidotes for poisons, general first aid, prevention and treatment of dermatitis. 
In the recipes section of the book, there are gentle hints (e.g. p13 remember that potassium hydroxide is a caustic and should on no account come in contact with the skin. When handling hydroxide in sticks protect the finger with a piece of paper but it is better to use this chemical in flake or pellet form, p14 as soon is caustic do not dip bare fingers in the developer, use tongs or rubber fingerstalls)

p50
After this section is a glossary/directory of photographic chemicals listing pertinent features and storage instructions
acetic acid glacial - water clear fluid with stinging smell, glass stoppered bottle, corrosive action

calgon - sodium hexa-metaphosphate  (not mentioning this is really a brand...)

hydrochloric acid spirits of slats
corrosive and poisonous
vapour dangerous to photographic materials

potassium ferricyanide - red prussiate of potash
dark red crystal poisonous corked bottle

potassium thiocyaniate pot sulphocycanide/ pot rhodanate
colourless crystals, poisonous

sulphuric acid oil of vitriol, colourless oily liquid strongly corrosive and poisonous 
when dilute acid is required, the acid must always be poured into the water, never the reverse otherwise the reaction attains explosive violence

uranium nitrate, uranyl nitrate
yellowish crystals, poisonous


War time subs p53

inconsistent in explaining what is short but appears that Metol was possibly hard to get hold of
have to change the whole formulate

sub for potassium salts - pot compounds are in short supply and difficult to obtain. All formulae in this book prescribe sodium carbonate, so no difficulties in this respect. Sodium carbonate freely subs for pot carbonate in formulae
also sodium bromide instead of pot bromide

sodium bisulphite can replace potassium metabisulphite

If acetic acid absent can use sodium bisulphite for stop bath, 
neither is acetic acid required of acid hardening fixing baths, use sodium hydrogen sulphate instead. 

- guessing that as these aren't incorporated into the recipes, this is an addendum written for the wartime editions, to go with the poor quality paper



removing developer stain 
rub with potassium permanganate until overall brown colour then wash well in the ordinary way, finally rind in strong soon of sodium bisulphite 

removing dev splashes from clothes
damp the spots with 5% pot permanganate, remand a few mo then decoloirse with 10% soon sodium bisulphite. 
exercise care with coloured clothes otherwise the tmt may cause the appearance of a bleached area


antidotes for poisons - suggests that sometimes things are drunk by mistake
alkaline drinks against acids
acid splashes in eyes
against caustic alkali, drink diluted vinegar or critic acid, suck ice
alkali splashes in the eyes
gas poisoning - fresh air
mercury poisoning


nothing seen about what the poisonous gas might be... or advice to avoid drinking things by mistake 

sensory - 
smells

also sounds - p41 when being dissolved, the ammonium per sulphate crystals should crackle, if this does not happen there is a possibility of the chemicals not being fresh. 

p27
developer improvers
reduce the risk of fog, even with stale material
marketed in solid or soon under various proprietary names, choice made according to the type of material/ film/ paper and required image tone
