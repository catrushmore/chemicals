Oral History of British Photography
Gregory, Joy, 1959- (speaker, female; interviewee)
2000-03-20, 2000-03-10
Tape 1 side B: Good at maths and loved chemistry. Got keen on photography because you weren't allowed in the darkroom till the sixth form, it was kept locked so she wanted to be in the forbidden space. Joy a tomboy.
Tape 2 Side A: Family didn't have a camera, Uncle Charles had one and took a lot of pictures. But had lots of pictures. Father's brother in law had own photography business in Jamaica. Had a teacher, Jill Morgan, who let Joy use the darkroom. The local art centre had a darkroom and Joy would print there. About 16-17 then. Parents bought her a proper SLR camera for her 18th birthday. Started taking pictures of her niece, has a complete chronicle of her growing up till she was about ten. Took pictures of friends. Did English, sociology, history and art at A level. Decided to come to London, worked for a publisher in accounts. But desperately wanted to be a photographer. Applied for a job at Conde Nast to work in the darkroom at Vogue and didn't get it because there were only men in the darkrooms. It was the mystery of photography and Joy wanted to find out what it was and how it worked. 
Tape 3 Side B: A degree course, very little academic input. In second year realised she had to work so did more. Did science and physics and learned the chemistry of photography and got friendly with Trevor Varley who was doing his MA or PhD on cyanotypes so she got interested in processes. Was always doing impossible processes. Became cavalier about the way she worked and used ideas from painting, didn't fit because was a fine artist on a commercial course. But she knew that photography on fine art courses wasn't any better than they had learned on foundation. Impossible to do anything on one's own or learn sophisticated skills - Joy wanted to learn all the skills and knew that you bring the ideas with you anyway
Tape 3 Side A: Needed money so worked as a technician in a girls school in Brixton. Then Maxine Walker suggested she work at N Paddington Community darkroom. Was involved with black and womens' photography groups. Keith Piper was at the RCA in environmental media and had seen Joy, Dmax was being set up at the time. N Paddington offered photography to people who wouldn't normally have access. Worked as administrator and chief cook and bottle washer with Maxine Walker and Ulrike Preiss in the darkrooms. APhotofusion needed two new staff and got Joy to set up their education programme and someone to work in the darkroom. Near home. The way these organisations which are politically correct are rife with ideas of traditional ways of being and functioning. The two staff were meant to have the same job and pay but it was unequal and left Joy to do much more.
