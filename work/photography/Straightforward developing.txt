good idea to use round bottles for the developer and square bottles (empty and well washed gin bottles or something for the fixers. Or you can do it th other way round. This will stop you from accidentally using the wrong bottle when groping for it in the dark. Have a couple of empty bottles handy also holding the same volume.

Don't need a darkroom, less a photo lab. Unless you have a daylight loading tank you need a place that cam be made dark for some ten minutes. Or use a changing bag.

to start with you will find it more convenient to use ready made. If using developer packets, dissolve the stuff inside. Not in a bottle - difficult, spills, mess, inaccurate. Need hot water, bottles crack. 
use a lab beaker or glazed / enabled or earthen ware pie dish. 
p24 inside developer package are 2 packets, one small one large
dissolve small first, then sir in big one until dissolved. Filter the solution into a clean bottle - 

tablets - proceed int eh same way using the 2 tablets as the 2 packets. Crush eau tabled when dropped into water. 
filtering removes dust, girt, undissolve chem, which would cause spots on neg.

can buy developer ready made .little more expensive. Don't get the idea that the makers are maing a lot of profit on a few ounces of water.

Stock solution to working solution exp.
