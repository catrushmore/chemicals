Working in a science museum and caring for a photography collection alerted me to a number of questions about photographic chemicals, because they were often perceived as problematic by widows and children clearing out a deceased amateur photographer's belongings. Were these chemicals still useful to anyone? Were they poisonous? Would the museum collect them? What should they do with them? Sometimes the bottles and boxes stamped with shop addresses provided traces of where...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Who</strong><br/>Who used photographic chemicals at home?<br/>
While instruction manuals and magazines portrayed a domestic darkroom as being not necessarily being permanently static, large or expensive, in an attempt to encourage more photographers to try developing their photographs at home, it remained a minority activity most often pursued by adolescent and young men. Neathercoat imagined 'innocent-looking' cyanide sticks 'in the hands of an enthusiastic, unsuspecting schoolboy' and the 'possible calamity to hims...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Using chems at home</strong><br/>Using photographic chemicals at home<br/>
Developing photographs needed a dedicated space, at least temporarily dedicated, if not a permanently set up dark space. Clean running water was desirable, but not a requirement, and diagrams of rigs that would fit over baths or utility room sinks, then could be packed away were published along with more more permanent installations. In the Kodak gallery at NMeM visitors can view a Pepper's Ghost illusion, where pressing a button reveals the transformation of...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Obtaining chemicals</strong><br/>Where were photographic chemicals available?<br/>
Chemists and photographic dealers were where these chemicals could be purchased. Could they also be mail order? These chemicals, at least in the purities specified and required for satisfactory results, were only available from specialist retailers, they were not on offer at more general stores such as grocers, ironmongers or supermarkets. <br/>
Photographic dealers were encouraged to cultivate rapport with their customers. Ilford published a course in sal...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Dangers</strong><br/>Look at hazards books<br/>
<br/>
What dangers, if any, are associated with storing or using them?<br/>
Shearcroft stresses using dedicated equipment, not reused from kitchen duty and certainly not "chemically filthy" hands. However, this is all with an eye to achieving the best possible results, rather than ensuring the comfort or safety of user (and those he shared the domestic space with). Clear labelling of the contents of bottles was also paramount in Shearcroft's instruction, although he did not elaborate...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Restriction</strong><br/>Are these dangers related to their withdrawal/ restriction or concealment?<br/>
Where there any public calls for action? No? useful to compare to other chemicals where people did feel outraged that they were available. Why, when these chemicals could be misused with fatal consequences, was there not any public concern? Could this be to do with the perception of the users themselves, ie nerdy, not a threat, hobbyists, competant? What about the list of prohibited chemicals re sabotage? <br/>
Could it be tha...</p>
