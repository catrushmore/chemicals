Festival of Britain

Watched 2 documentaries and read Atkinson’s book

no mention of crystallography or what people thought about the science on display, seemed to be very much focussed on the South Bank rather than the South Kensington part. The book did mention crystallography in the section on restaurants, but nothing is said of what people thought of it, only the bad food. It is not in the index. 

Focus seemed to be on “nice”, films of people walking through exhibitions, not really taking in the incredibly deep at times content. Architecture seemed to be the big pull with the book commenting that many people were inspired to take it up after visiting the exhibtion, and that architects were really working with planners to shape a better way of living given the opportunities of flattened housing. 

Interesting section in the book about the exhibitions put on by the Ministry of Information during the war and how this shaped many of the displays at the Festival. Garden pests were depicted with swastikas on them to encourage people to fight pests early before they got hold and destroyed the crops they were growing to reduce strain on supply networks.
