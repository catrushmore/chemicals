O-Cedar assure me that they have now found the answer to the eternal cry “What ever shall we give them?” each time a wedding invitation arrives, and I must admit that it is not always easty to find something reasonably priced. A list of things needed, left with a store is a good idea, except that by the time I manage to look at the list everything under £10 has been crossed off! However O-Cedar are selling a carefully selected range of their mops and polishes packed into a gay and most ttractive gift box. Selling at 75s each these gift boxes are obtainable at Harrods, Selfridges and other large stores.
