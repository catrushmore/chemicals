On "child centred society"

The idea of creating a child-centred society in Britain can be traced back to the civil rights movements of the 1960s. Thus for the more radical adult advocates of ‘children’s rights’ the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) [i] (and its implementation via the Children’s Acts of 1989 and 2004) is a culmination of the broader movement for civil and political rights won by women, black people, gay people and disabled people — often grouped together under the umbrella of the marginalised ‘Other’. However, the fact that, unlike these other groups, children did not organise and win their own ‘rights’ highlights the important fact that children’s rights and the ‘participation agenda’ which promote them is very much a reflection of current adult dilemmas and preoccupations

Wanstall was writing about the riots, so focussed mainly on "being heard" and "participation" but this summary is useful in thinking about why campaigns are concerned with accidents occurring to children, other than the fact that they are less knowledgeable about the world. Jackson writes about the importance of experiencing and learning for themselves about hazards, rather than being wrapped in cotton wool. However, Wantstall sees the child centred society as only taking place after the 1960s, when child safety at home was already a concern and some types of accidents were already reducing  (??). This cannot be thought of separately to the increases in drugs prescriptions on the NHS, the bills faced by them, the availability of antidepressants and how this type of drug was disproportionately represented in non intentional child poisonings. The 60s would also have seen the start of paraquat poisonings, but as Jackson has documented, putting inappropriate unsafe substances in pop bottles was occurring long before this.
