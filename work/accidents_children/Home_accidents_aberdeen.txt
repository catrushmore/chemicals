p29
no seasonal incidence for all accidents grouped together
nor really for falls and cuts

p32burns and scalds - higher in cold months when artificial heating is used

p32 day of the week - 
0-5 - no change,  most at home all week, uniformly exposed to domestic hazards through the week.
p33 
young adults - Saturday followed by Monday (women monday worst, sat second worst)
middle aged Monday is worst, Tuesday second worst
'strain of wash-day' leaving women tired and accident prone on Tuesday
p34 elderly Monday worst, Friday second worst for men and women alike
possible the elderly man helps in the monday laundry or does other domestic chores when his wife is washing and his unaccustomed exertion leaves him fatigued and accident-prone, while his assistance enables his wife to endure monday without being excessively tired the next day. 

p46
burns show a markedly decreased liability in households of one and two persons, a slightly decreased liability in households of three and an increased liability in larger households. 
	does this mean that the greater the number of people there are in a household, the more likely it is that someone will leave something in an inappropriate container, in the wrong place, where it could be swallowed?

 p65 Aberdeen home Safety drive was a sustained campaign b the staff of the health and welfare dept, teaching and persuasion by health visitors in homes, supplemented by group teaching at parents clubs, classes of expectant mothers, old peoples clubs etc
 
 p66 susceptibility of elderly to home accident is common k. Yet there wa an amazing absence of accidents other than falls in old people
 
 p69 poisoning other than gas, restricted to young children
 swallowed substances ditto
 
 p71 almost all cases of poisoning occurred in ch under 6, almost all cases of swallowed substance in ch under 10 so preventive efforts should be concentrated on persons responsible of young children
