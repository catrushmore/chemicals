Abstract:
In the UK, home accidents involving bleach products account for about 25% of all household cleaning products and 0.15% of all home accidents. There is no evidence of general long-term harm from accidental exposure to household bleach. A German proposal to restrict the retail sale of bleach unless it is highly buffered with alkali was evaluated and shown to lack justification. The report also makes recommendations to reduce the incidence of home accidents from household bleach.

Abstract:
This Which? report identifies potentially harmful chemicals found within seemingly innocent household items such as shower gel and shaving foam, and looks to see whether popular brands contain them. The possible harmful effects of these chemicals are discussed as well as existing legislation as regards chemicals. It concludes: that there are too many uncertainties about the potentially harmful effects of some chemicals; encourages authority and industry to prove chemicals are safe before they are used; and makes a number of recommendations for improving legislation in this area. Further sources of information are provided.
