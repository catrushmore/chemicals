The Consumers’ Association began life as the Association for Consumer Research Ltd in 1957, changing its name in 1958. SZ was a vice-president of the company from its origin until his death. *How much influence or how active is a VP in this instance? To stay as VP for the entire time shows that it something he wanted to be associated with, felt strongly about.*

File SZ/CA/1 consists chiefly of correspondence but also includes: a copy of the company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association; some newsletters, circulars, and minutes of annual general meetings; and copies of the 1972-1973 and 1976-1977 annual reports.

File SZ/CA/2 relates to the establishment and work of a sister organisation, the Advisory Centre for Education (ACE). After initially refusing because of his position as a civil servant, SZ did accept the invitation to become one of ACE’s vice-presidents and actively supported its efforts to raise funds for annual summer schools for sixth-formers.

This series includes material emanating from other associated organisations, such as the Consumers' Association's parent body, the Association for Consumer Research.

Insight into how he dealt with organisations. 
"Zuckerman had renewed his connection with the London Zoo in 1955 when he became a member of the council of the Zoological Society of London, and two years later became secretary. He claimed to have supposed that this title was largely honorific, but passivity did not come easily to him and he became in effect chief executive officer. "
