firefighting

eighteenth century
regular uncontrolled urban fires 
warehouses a particular concern - great economic losses.
who was responsible for controlling fires - private companies and parishes
fire engines relations to pumps removing water from mines
public demonstrations of engine, adverts/announcements, narratives of fires in newspapers which included mention of the fire engine by name

1723 - public experiments extinguish fire by bombs (containing what?)
phosporus glacial - suffocate fire
Ambrose Godfrey

then Charles Povey ((improved version))

fireworks banned in 1761



not so much put out by water, but by the explosion ?

were they automatic? could the be installed where the gunpoweder might be set off by heat?
