Poisons and their detection

p82
chlorine gas is mentioned in terms of disinfecting, but not discussed in the text or any cases given, the attention focuses on those involved in the manufacture of bleaching powder. 

p89
sulphuric acid
deaths from sulphuric acid in england and wales for 5 yrs ending 1916
accident or negligence, 8 males, 3 females total 11
suicide 13 males no females total 13

mostly accidental or suicidal, rarely criminal. criminal poisoning victims are children, most often newborns. 

accidental poisoning most common among children. oily 
p90 
syrupy looking sulphuric acid when pure may be mistaken for glycerine or syrup while the dark commercial acid might by a careless person be confounded with porter or any dark looking medicine

midwife in error administered sulphuric acid clyster in error
abortion by sulphuric acid injection
accidental administration of sulphuric acid clyster by army physician, apothecary late at night was woken to find the linseed oil who gave sulphuric in error

cleaning is not mentioned, 
p93 disfiguring burns, committed by women, revengeful jealousy dashed acid into face of the object of their resentment
nothing on why they would have the acid, or where procured. 
refers to Falck and Vietor

p95

p110 hard to tell from looking at specimens the difference between sulphuric and hydrochloric

does not say whether hydrochloric was used in the household, or why so many deaths. why was it so available for suicides?

p114
5yrs ending 1916 16 cases of fatal accidents, 13 suicides involving nitric acid.

p116
heedlessness - 
woman bought small quantity of aqua fortis for purpose of allaying toothache by a local application. attempted to pour acid direct from the bottle into cavity of the tooth. the acid went down her throat and usual symptoms followed. threw up a perfect cast of the gullet (preserved in University College museum) and rapidly died. Nitric acid mistaken for various liquids and used by injection as an abortive.

p127
caustic potash and soda
little difference in local effects so treated together
potash - KHO hydrate of potassium
pure - white solid in form of sticks
phramacueitcal proparations, potassium hydrate and solution of potash
caustic sticks aof potash and lime used to be official in the British pharmacopoeia
Film's caustic still in commerce - 2 parts potassium hydrate and one part time
Vienna paste equal weithgts of potash and lime made into a paste w rectified spirit or glycerin

carbonate of potash - K2CO2 + 1.5 H2O
salt of tartar is sold at oilshops for 
p128
cleaning purposes, either in pure state or darkish moist mass containing impurities

bicarbonate of potash KHCO3
no uses listed

Caustic soda sodium hydrate NaHO
white solid, similar in appearance to potassium hydrate
no uses listed

sodii carbonas - carbonate of soda Na2CO310H20
pure for medicinal purposes is colourlesss and transparent rhombic octahedrons

bicarbonate of soda NAHCO3 minute crystals or more commonly as a white powder. Sold for household purposes of two kinds - second of a dirty white colour and pure, the other 'best' is a white mass of much greater purity. Gavel water is a solution of hypochlorite of soda, action is poisonous, more from the caustic alkali than from the chlorine and is therefore included

stats - poisonings by fixed alkalies not so frequent as poisoning by ammonia. 
27 cases, 2 of which were criminal administerings of Javelle water, 5 were suicidal, 22 or 81.5% died
in the 5 years ending 1916 in England and Wales there were 11 deaths from poising by the fixed alkalies, 9 male and 2 females, all due to accident not a single case of suicide or murder

[wonder why more men - is the potassium a photographic chemical?]

p134
Potassic chlorate KCl03
when rubbed with sulphur in a mortar it detonates
used in calico printing and dyeing, matches and fireworks, detonators
in medicine
accidental abortion - handful of nitre taken in mistake for Glaubers salts
if either potassic chlorate or sodium chlorate is mixed with fresh blood it shows after a little while peculiar changes - the clear red colour at first produced passes within a few hours into a dark red brown which gradually becomes pure brown 
[sodic chlorate does not get its own entry]
p135
more than 40 cases recorded of poisonous symptoms directly ascribed to chlorate of potassium, 29 terminated fatally, generally nephritis

p136
Dr Fountain in 1858 on experimenting on himself took 29.2 grms (7.6 arms) and died on the seventh day
a man 30yrs died in four days after having taken 48 grms (12.5 arms) of sodic chlorate in six hours.

p175
Bisulphide of Carbon, carbon disulphide, carbon sulphide CS2
colourless, volatile fluid, commecial samples have most repulsive na penetrating odour, but chemically pure has a smell which is not disagreeable. solvent. also used for disinfection guppies, the liquid being burned in a lamp. 
in spite of the cheapness and numerous applications of this liquid poisoning is v rare. 
most problems described involved in exposure through manufacturing processes, at the factory. 

p179
Carbolic acid
gives some brand names
Macdougall's disinfecting powder - certain proportion of impure carbolic acid to a calico sulphate
Calvert's carbolic acid powder - made by adding carbolic acid to the siliceous residue room the mfcr of alumnic sulphate from shale
tar acids are all powerful poisons, the most accessible and the most reckless distributed. 
we find them at the bedside of the sick, in back-kitchens, in stable, in public and private closets and urinals and in almost all places where there are likely to be foul odours or decomposing matters therefore no wonder that poisoning by carbolic acid has of late yrs assumed large proportions. 
p180
5yrs 1916 
363 people accident or suicide deaths
taken in mistake for various alcoholicdrinks, or simply by mistake
generally the term carbolic acid is not used by coroners juries or medical men in a strictly chemical sense, term being ade to include disinfecting builds which are almost wholly composed of the cresols dn contain scarily any phone. Only occasionally possible to state whether pure or mixture was cause of poisoning. 
p189

potassium cyanide suicide - 109 m, 12 f total 121

hydric and potassic cyanides one the favourite means of self desctrcionemployed by photographers, chemist and scientific medical men and other in position where such means are always at hand, but of late years, the popular knowledge of poisons has increased, and self poisoning by the cyanides scarcely belongs to a particlar class. a fair proportion of deaths are due to accident or unfortunate mistakes
