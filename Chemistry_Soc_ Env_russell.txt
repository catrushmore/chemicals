weedkiller: 
p175
sodium chlorate found aid application as a weedkiller by the powerfully oxidising nature of the chlorates created hazards for the workers. In fireworks factories strict rules ensure that chlorate and sulphur pass through the works by separate routes. 

carbon tetrachloride

advert for Albright and Wilson's pure octet, (incredibly used for medicine!) Why is this incredibly, in tiny amounts its prob a v good solvent and will definitely make you feel different if not better. No date given for the advert. 
p269
organic compounds have been shown to have a gaiety of undesirable effect on the human body such as benzene, carbon tetrachloride and so on. Action has been taken to withdraw them form common circulation. 

Chemicals and the domestic consumer
broad, brief summary
- dyestuffs, ancient, plant, Perkin, nothing about users, or demand. (p25)
- pigments and fillers - heavy chemicals, paints, (p26)
- p27
- polymers - manmade fibres, fashion industry (not users), plastics affordable attractive and serviceable substitutes for expensive wooden leather ivory metal and glass products. Research to improve plastics plus persuasion and clever adverting required to overcome earlier problems, little doubt that the poor performance of early plastics reflected badly on the public image of the chemical industry as a whole. Nothing is said about the image of the chemical industry now with the amount of plastic waste it generates. 
- soap and detergents - little of no attempt to use soap adverts as a means of improving the public image of the chemical industry
- p29
- perfumes and pharmaceuticals - plants, distillation ancient. Most perfumes in wide use now manufactured by organic synthesis. Still nothgin about users or demand, or how the companies connected with these audiences for their products.  
- p29
- agrochemicals - late 19th C hardly any controls on the sale or user of poisons such as copper or lead arsenates, pastes continuing red phosphorus, strychnine, thallium and mercury compounds, sodium fluoride or cyanide for use in the garden or on the farm. 1919 arsenic poising in England due to American apples treated with aresnious oxide - led to legal levels of tolerance for arsenic, then other poisons. From the late 20s regulations controlling the sale and use of pesticides were progressively introduced until they are amongst the most thoroughly supervised of all chemicals. 

p29 In addition to core industries about, large mfc sector uses chem products and methods in the mfc of consumer goods. Secondary chemical industries exert a very impt influence on the public perception  of the chemical industry as a whole because their products are in daily use and are consequently much better known.
