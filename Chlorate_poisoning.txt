Case Report
homicidal chronic sodium chlorate poisoning 
Hortense Jansen and Jan Zeldenrust (Netherlands) 
Forensic Sci 1(1972) 103-105

observations demonstrate that murder by sodium chlorate is possible if the poison is administereed intermittently in relatively small doses. This is contrary to Schwarz' general statemtn (in German) that in the view of the high lethal dose this herbicide is inappropriate for criminial poisoning, in that Schwarz has not taken into account the possibility of internmittent administration. 

police investigations - paper bag with inscription Weed-Killer (sodium chlorate) and of a coffee box partly filled with the herbicide. Near thsi coffee box was a small spoon. Tox analysis revelaed presecnce of chlorate in the urine, detection of hlorate in the residue of the beer that had been served previous night. 
administered 2-3 times per week, for 5 weeks. 
elimination exclusively by kidneys (other than vomit)
