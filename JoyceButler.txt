Woodbrook, Quaker College, near Sellyoak - spent a year there, international diploma (served in shops, things like that - went back to college hadn't known what to do)
studied other countries

went to league of nations for school trip

Being a Quaker is an international field. Has not remained a Quaker, retired during the war, fraught -  fighting was wrong, cause was right. 

private, secretarial work after college. Lived at home. 

became member of labour party, age 20
what stimulated, not sure...
trying to relate to Left Book  Club - but that would have been after the war. Have to avoid such a war again - what changes do we need to prevent it? Labour govt came in on that sort of feeling.

Met husband through political interests. 

Worked when first married - odd things, like lecturing, part time things 
involved in thoughts about a better society, position of women, it was as if we were starting again, town planning and so on. 

huband worked with Co-op - paid employment

how did you become member of wood green council
always interested in politics, there were vacancies
what was experience when on council?
don't feel that it was a new experience, I just got on with it. Always interested in the kinds of thigns that the council had committees on. 

with children its good to get into something different in the evenings. 

hated high rise buildings, flatly refused. Was outvoted, we have got two towerblocks. I suffer from claustrophobia, don't like being in lifts. 

NHS, welfare, social security, everything was happening. 

not directly involved in health

leader of the council 1954 - 
Plenty of ideas, knew what I wanted to do, that's quite useful. 

deputy mayor, wanted me to be mayor, must draw a line somewhere, I've got 2 small children and a home. 
wood green, tottenham and hornsey = harringey. 

chairman of harringey in 1965 - not a great deal to do there, didn't settle down until the next year, with all the new burroughs. 

1955 - 1975 Parliament must have taken up a lot of time
how did you go about getting into parliament? do you have to do a lot of campaigning?
Go to meetings, go to certain buildings, sort of carrries you along. Went out with a loud speaker. 
Husband was doing something else, he was up in Rutland. He didn't get into Parliament - not a safe seat.

Side two
described self as housewife when you got into parliament, article did mention that you'd done a great deal of other work, lectured in america on foreign policy
	Oh I didn't lecture, I may have spoken because people can get up and speak at society of friends...

magazine was women and home

education - no
mainly it was housing. Alwasy felt aggreived about how things were done in regard to women. Race relations bill, thought well, what about women? Readapted it to women. Introduced it, never got place on ballot. Somebody else had a place but needed a bill - I asked "Why not have my bill?" - so someone else got it. 


quite a lot of environmental things - for a long time, questions certain days, certain ministers. Agriculture one day, usually the only woman in the house at the time, asking questions, asking questions about the countryside and so on. All the farmers were there. Force feeding and that sort of thing, the type of agriculture [intensive farming] battery hens and that sort of thing. Quite active in the agriculture field because of that. Little voice piping up about other things and all this growling. 

always been interested in health - the cancer control campaign
consumer campaign, consumerism booming and all sorts of horrors. [frustratingly does not go into these]
Co-operative MP- co op in trade. 

Did the Co-op put any requests or pressure on you do do certain things? 
Not directly no. There was a group, we met once a month or so, so we kept in touch. If someone was being left out, we were asked questions. Very little pressure. 

was Fred Willey's parliamentary secretary, some of the things I was interested in I couldn't do anything about because I was his pps. 

decontrol - rent act?
looking at it the other day, think I was on the ctte - may have been that one. 

ctte chairman you can't speak - I was chairman for quite a lot of cttes, surprised to find I was making speeches, which was very unusual.

64-79 chairman's panel - one of the 20 or so people, so when a bill goes to committee you can be a chairman. 

lots more exciting in local govt, eveyone's v well behaved in parliament don't have to do very much its fairly dull.

joint chair parliamentary committee on pollution think I helped to set it up - if a group of members feels somethign is being neglected they can form a ctte, have meetings, influence events. 
was it a sucess? 
yes, when I mentioned the environment, that was what I was talking about.
can't really fail when there's an issue of that kind because its so obvious to everyone. It was early days then, people didn't really know.

environment issue swallowed up land and national resources, a bit hazy about that. don't always know what's happening behind the scenes. Set up a ministry to have a particular minister, then they drop it. 
be there, do odd jobs, one minister will probably overload a pps and the other will not use them enough. FT Willey was very nice. 

vice chair of parliamentary labour party - regular weekly meeting, sit up on the platform, so if the chair can't be there, you take over. 

annual meetings  - annual conference 
able to go as parliamentary section, get in without being a delegate, not very much different from what comes over on the Television.

Vallance, Elizabeth
Women in the house

p62 Butler's parents were members of the Society of Friends, and, although officially uninvolved in politics they had a deep interest in community and social work.  (this is in the context of looking for how women get into politics - that there is often some kind of family influence)
p63 this gives sense of politics being important, significant and accpatble.
development of sense of personal efficacy - individual can personall affect the course of social development and the way that society operates, ande that individual problems and in justic should be acknowledged and can be resolved.  Problems can be resolved by people themselve. Many women do not believe in their own comptetance. All the  women I interviewed had a very strong sense of their effectiveness as witnessed by their belief in ability to do things and change things. 


Joyce Butler in Hansard

First sci/tech debate in House of Commons
Radioactivity, Greater London
With respect to nuclear fall out, mentions an Observer article, monitoring of imported foods - currently only flour. Hospital disposal. Windscale incident. Inaccurate estimates of the amount released. Urban environment means that which is deposited on buildings and roads etc is washed off into the storm sewers, raising possibility of this area being particularly contaminated. Calls for system of monitoring food stuffs, environmental (water, air)  rainfall. Calls for list. Calls for training of public health officials.

Clean Rivers
Practical difficulties of sewage disposal, how will the govt help? Questions whether Thames, PLA, Lee Conservancy are not covered. Supports the BIll, in favour of improved env and health.

1963 was a big year for chemicals - fluoridation and chems for the gardener booklet

Water Fluoridation
Expresses doubts as part of a larger debate. Little research presented that hasn't been aggregations or averages, tests haven't been done. Points out that the British Pharmaceutical Codex, 1934, under the heading "Sodium Fluoride", states: Chronic poisoning may occur from the continued ingestion of small quantities of 605 fluorides and is characterised by slowly progressive wasting, anaemia and brittleness of the bones.  Stresses lack of research, effect on individuals, source of flouride as waste product of aluminium industry. 
once fluoride is added to the water supply no one can contract out of imbibing it. This is in contrast to all other forms of medication because there is no control on the amount which the individual may take.
