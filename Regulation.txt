Searching for regulat* consumer goods, 
 - much on financial regulation, i.e. of banks and savings etc

regulat* cosmetic Britain
throughout that cosmetics might be a useful comparison to household chemicals, but the focus on cosmetics in Britan appears to be on procedures (surgical and non) rather than cosmetic

regulat* chemical
(an awkward search, even when restricted to history sources, as biochemical results pollute it)


1980s fits well with this as  a cut off point, as the 1990s is when a lot more regulation starts happening through the EU. 1990s has been identified, not without contestation, as the point when EU started to be more precautionary than the US, who had previously led the way. This has been explained by EU increasing its legitimisation as it grew (accumulated more members) which had trade implications - if want to trade with EU have to meet their standards. Previously this had been directed by American made legislation. 
1980s formal risk assessments began to be more influential in the US, so going against the previous apparent willingness to impose restrictions without evidence, only with uncertainty. (vogel my page 51)
policy makers responsive to pressure groups, which are lined up in this argument as a determining factor behind the seeming flip-flop of US - EU stance on regulation
