In this presentation I want to focus on the domestic users of chemistry.  My research explores the 1930s to the 1980s, a period which ends with the proposition of the "hygiene hypothesis" of allergy, certainly an unexpected health effect of using chemistry. While these users employed chemistry whether they knew or cared about the details or not to kill germs, remove limescale, lift dirt, eradicate weeds and to process photographic film at home, some were accidentally misused while others were also used to deliberately threaten and harm people. These uses ultimately altered which chemicals could continue to be available, and the forms that they were available in.  This is a story of human behaviour, of business history as well as of the chemistry itself. 

I want to emphasise the role of the user of chemistry in this discussion, to see how they featured in the attempts made by companies and regulatory bodies to anticipate, understand and control use and therefore users of chemicals.
