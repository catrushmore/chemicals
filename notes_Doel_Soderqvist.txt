The historiography of contemporary science, technology and medicine

oral history
here long, repeated interviews are described, with trust being a significant part. The aim of the author was to get beyond the mask, the repeated stories that were no different to the published accounts. This is a situation that is particular to public figures, or high profile scientists/ scientists involved in high profile events. In my situation, I do not have the time to build up trust, and the information I am looking for does not carry the same weight, but the participant still has a mask. They have a presentation of themselves, their home life, their values that they have constructed ini a particular way to cope with their situation, choices and viewers. This is something that I have to be aware of as an oral history interviewer, and I can still probe inconsistencies to get behind the mask. 

The use of documents, brought out to jog memories, but at a particular time to contradict/ challenge the interviewee is somewhat relevant to my work, the use of objects or pictures can function in the same way, although the aim is not necessity to correct, more to understand where they were coming from.

not trickle down of knowledge from elite to masses. Influence extends in multiple direction. This means that public interests and agendas set the stage for and even influence th context of science. 


Shapin and Barns - when does popularisation become a covert mode of social conrol. Unwitting pawn in someone's institutional agenda? What good is literacy if people remain powerless against bureaucracies that camouflage empire building and class related agendas as public understanding of science.
