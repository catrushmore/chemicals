Survival photography project - interweave academic research with our concern to encourage  a self reliant non-fetisihistic, low cost approach to the tools and materials of photography
this project on alternative photo technology has investigated many common industrial and domestic products and found ways of using them in photography. The workshop's historical researches have brought to light many old processes formulas and methods which are still useful today. The photo chemical research project has resulted in an indexed collection of 2000 substitutes and alternatives to commercial photo chemicals plus a subsidiary list of a thousand items which can no longer be purchased commercially but can be cheaply made with the formulas we have collected. Several parts of the project have provided material for successful workshops like the The Home Made Camera children's workshops which resulted in the unforgettable Welliflex and J-Pak camera.These and similar projects continue to expand, taking on more importance as unemployment rises and economic instability causes further cutback in the photographic industry and retail trade.
