The Incredible Shrinking Woman

Described as a feminist comedy, it was a 1981 remake of the 1957 science fiction film, the Incredible Shrinking Man. It was poorly received by critics and was something of a flop at the box office, but I examine it in my ongoing PhD thesis for its representation of women and their relationship to chemical products used in the home. In comparison to very bleak The Incredible Shrinking Man which was based on a the combination of a couple of freak exposures to chemicals which were prominent in the minds of people living in the 1950s - pesticide spraying and nuclear fallout, the newer version played with the idea of living amidst the mixture of synthetic chemicals that you have willingly invited into your home. Although the same issues of fallout and pesticide use were around in the 1980s, albeit in different forms, remaking the story about domestically used chemicals suited the time extremely well, as questions about multiple chemical sensitivity, consumerism in general, the power of women as consumers and activists, especially concerned with chemicals, health and environment,  were coming to the fore. 

I first saw this film on TV as a child, it seemed to be a staple of the late 80s and early 90s morning film slots. Uncontrollable shrinking, falling down a plughole and being presumed dead was terrifying to me. Now this film is a part of my ongoing PhD thesis, which is concerned with using chemicals in the home.
