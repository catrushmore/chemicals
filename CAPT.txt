CA/CAP

CAP emerged from a conference in 1977 on Children, the environment and accidents. 
Hugh Jackson said that ROSPA were not interested in bringing together the child safety aspects of their different strands of interests. (http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/1/1/4.full.pdf+html)

 home safety measures/strategies/policies seem to be unrelated to efforts that can be made regarding the changes made by manufactuers. Why has this been so separate? Would be more effective if these were dealt with together? Bittrex seem to be the only ones involved in safety promotion at the moment, but surely other companies supported RoSPA, the Red Cross, or CAP's efforts, if they hadn't instigated their own? tension between home and industry and regulation of activities in each. 
 
 repeatedly state that deprivation is a key factor in raising the risks faced by children, but do not look systematically at behaviours, although the early work by Hugh Jackson (the use of medicine cabinets, things being brought home in 'pop' bottles http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1912194/pdf/brmedj02107-0075.pdf ) got close, this does not seem to have been followed up, possibly because these are completely uncontrollable matters. Jackson does mention social and intellectual inadequacy, and also cites a study that highlighted that unintentional poisoning was not the result of fecklessness or lack of thought.

 Avery and Jackson2 provide a useful summary of children's products covered by regulations or standards in the UK. At the other end of the spectrum, legislative approaches can require repetitive action—for example, the use of car seat belts or bicycle helmets. Intermediate between the two are child resistant containers to prevent poisoning and fencing of domestic swimming pools, each of which offer a degree of passive protection when used correctly.

  HOME ENVIRONMENT
Although the roads are the leading cause of injury deaths in childhood (about one child per day), the home remains the setting for a significant number of deaths and large numbers of non-fatal injuries. Preschool children are particularly vulnerable in the home environment, not just because homes are inherently unsafe, but because this is where these children spend most of their time. The domestic environment presents a greater problem than the road environment because it is less amenable to the types of regulatory approach than are available in the road environment. Local councils have a statutory responsibility to implement road safety, but for safety promotion within the home, there is no statutory requirement and staff dedicated to home safety issues vary.

The range of potential hazards in the home is vast and exposure to these varies as a child develops. Injury types include house fires, other burns and scalds, falls, poisonings, drownings, choking and suffocation, and entrapments and lacerations from glass and other sharp objects. Sinnott points out that children make use of their homes, “in ways that seem to them to be reasonable, but have not apparently been foreseen by the designer”. 46 These uses include children who, “crawl about the floor, climb onto the window ledge, squeeze through stair balustrades, slide down the stair hand-rail, swing on the gate, run from room to room, and ride bikes inside as well as out”.46

When was the 'buy safe' campaign launched?  - related to the Bitrex taste test, demonstrating to parents that they should look for products that contain Bitrex, using personal experience admittedly in a controlled, artificial setting.  Putting responsibility on consumer / housewife to look for particular products engineered to contain this chemical, which they can then rely upon to be so unpleasant as to not be eaten in great amounts. Not a substitute for supervision though, company cannot take on all responsibility.

POISONING PREVENTION
Among those families who reported poisonous substances in their home at the baseline, those in the intervention group were twice as likely to have removed these substances at follow up than were families in the comparison group (RR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.3 to 3.2). No difference in the level of positive change was seen between the groups, however, with respect to disposal of unused medications (RR = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.4 to 1.4), nor were any differences noted in the proportion of families reporting familiarity with sources of help for poisoning or ingestion.

Only 20% of comparison families reported an increase in knowledge about the use of ipecac compared with 34% of intervention families (RR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.5). Intervention families were also more than four times as likely to report the presence of ipecac in the home at follow up (RR = 4.7, 95% CI 3.0 to 7.3).

In the accident/injury debate, most work has focused on understanding the **public perception** of the word “accident”. Most recently, Girasek undertook a national telephone survey of 943 adults in the United States.4 The majority (71%) of respondents did indeed report that they believed that “accidents” were **unpredictable**. However, respondents also reported that “accidents” were **preventable** (83%). Most associated “accident” with **something that was not done on purpose—that is, unintentional.** In another national telephone survey in the US, Eichelberger et al reported that parents' beliefs in the avoidability of injuries were equally strong regardless of whether “accident” or “injury” was used.5
