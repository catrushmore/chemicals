 repeatedly state that deprivation is a key factor in raising the risks faced by children, but do not look systematically at behaviours, although the early work by Hugh Jackson (the use of medicine cabinets, things being brought home in 'pop' bottles http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1912194/pdf/brmedj02107-0075.pdf ) got close, this does not seem to have been followed up, possibly because these are completely uncontrollable matters. Jackson does mention social and intellectual inadequacy, and also cites a study that highlighted that unintentional poisoning was not the result of fecklessness or lack of thought.
