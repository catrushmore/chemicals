chemical search: 
results predominantly to do with drugs and health, especially contraception and reproductive health. There are reports on pollution, such as oil spills and the chemicals that break up the spill being worse than the oil itself, and the fact of chemicals being found in breast milk. That article was interesting as it focused on the organisational and awareness raising campaign of the German women but not really on any practical actions that anyone could take. It didn't say to stop breastfeeding but it didn't attempt to address the claims of severity of detecting such chemicals in the milk, or to address what might be done in the UK. 

An article on thrush was probably the most interesting, revealing that some people may perfume, deodorise, use bubble bath or otherwise introduce unnecessary chemicals and that this was a major step in overcoming the infection.

Is focused on negotiating and workplace equipment and rights, not protecting self at home.
Effect on fertility is prioritised over cancer, which is not mentioned. Stress related seems to be more of a problem than chemical exposure though it highlights trichloroethylene (trike) exposure to typists/office workers, hairdressers' exposure to toxic sprays, dyes and detergents, packing and processing various chemicals
"women working at home may be at risk from unsafe wiring or dangerous chemical sprays (aerosols) such as pesticides and polishes, in many cases it is the same sort of chemical that women are exposed to at home as out at work. 62% workers in cosmetic industry are female. The harmful effects of various combinations of chemicals inhaled or applied to the body are virtually unknown."
