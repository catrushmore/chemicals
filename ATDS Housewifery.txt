ATDS Housewifery and Laundry work book 1923

in section on sanitation, it describes the workings of the WC, but not when or how to clean it. p53
"the water cleans it by means of scouring and cascading action. The pan should be flushed every time the water closet is used."

in contrast, the refuse bin should scoured with strong hot soda water and powdered bath brink, or paraffin and bath brick. Should be sprinkled with chloride of lime or carbolic powder to deter flies. (p56)

p62 plumbing - in districts where water is excessively hard a deposit of 'fur' [no explanation] will collect inside the boiler... periodically the 'fur must be removed and a plumber should be called in whenever this appears necessary. [interesting that the fur is not given a name, and that it is not a job to be tackled oneself]

p64
stain removal - salts of lemon is  a poisonous substance and should be used with care, handled with a bone spoon as the acid corrodes metal. [acid potassium oxalate, salts of sorrel, potassium hydrogen oxalate]

This book was after the Poisons and Pharmay Act of 1906/8? but before the 1926 Poisons Law, so maybe this is why there is such readiness to use acids. 
Porcelains do not get a mention in this book, only enamelware and marble (not other stone) so not sure what special attention was given to sinks and toilet bowls, and toilets do not really appear in the work plan, only the chamber [assume pot] "empty the chamber into the slop pail, rinse it with hot water and leave a little clean water to stand in it. *no cloth* is needed."
