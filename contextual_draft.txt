1930s
The period under investigation starts at a time of worldwide economic depression. The number of Britains unemployed had reached 2.5 million. It might be expected that household expenditures were examined by housewives, that stains to clothes would be removed to avoid having to buy new ones, that the expenses incurred on keeping a house in order might be economised on by not using a domestic servant, by knowing enough about which chemicals could be used for multiple cleaning and household purpses, or choosing well priced, effective multipurpose products. [EVIDENCE]

1939
War breaks out, but in the lead up to it, there had been much discussion of the possibility of chemical weapons. The distribution of gas masks, gas drills reinforced the fears. Some household chemicals were recommended as treatment for exposure to mustard gas.  [ARRRRGGHHH - where is my spreadsheet/ pictures?]

With certain supply lines cut off, chemical manufacture had to become self sufficient, or stop producing certain products for consumers ,with any production being diverted for war use. Packaging was affected by the desire to conserve metals and paper, so where possible tins became cardboard boxes and the cardboard became flimsier, the colours more drab and utilitarian, though sometimes having extensive copy about why that was.  Recycling and reuse were encouraged patriotically. The necessity of keeping rationed clothes looking good presented a boon to dry cleaning fluid manufacturers keen to provide alterntives to petrol (rationed) and benzene.  The upheaval and dirt of bombing, lodgers or evacuees presented an extra burden of cleaning to their hosts, who wanted to keep respectable, healthy, homely facilities.  Grimy, tedious and awkward tasks like cleaning the oven could be framed by advertisers as contributing to the war effort, in this case, cleaning the oven was a method of reducing fuel consumption, if not saving the energy of the housewife often depicted on hands and knees, but smiling as she worked. 


New garden products came onto the market to help inexperienced gardeners feed their vegetables and fruit correctly, maximising production and minimising wastage of chemicals if they were applied in the wrong proportions. 

As more households had indoor toilets, even multiple toilets, there was increased pressure for cleanliness and most importantly, deodorisation. It would be hard to find even the most dedicated of housekeeper who wanted to spend long on this task, so products that did the job fast or were permanently present so that a cleaning task could be avoided almost entirely, were very appealing. 

The availability of new synthetic materials for the home and garments meant a new set of rules about stain removal and appriate treatment had to be learned by those who wanted to keep their fashionable products looking good. Along with the new wave of domestic labour saving appliances came a demand for chemical products. Had anything similar been seen with electification/ gasification?  

A need to maximise the productive capacity of Britain's farmland meant that in the 1960s when a completely new method of farming was developed to accompany a new weedkiller invented by ICI. Gardening was a popular expression of domesticity DIY and if there were miracle weedkillers to lighten the load of continual vigilance against weeds, gardeners wanted them. Green, verdant lawns and neat orderly gardens could be interpreted as a reaction against burned out, bombed and disorderly landscapes of war [did someone say this? e.g. Church, or one of the gardening history books?). This was an arena where people could be in charge (not the weeds).

At the same time there was a growing awareness of the unknowns and unintended consequences associated with the use of herbicides and pesticides on farms. Visible bird deaths from poison-dressed seeds, quieter hedgerows and fields, bald verges became the subject of public debate as Rachel Carson's Silent Spring was read. The British Government were keen to stress that the situation in America was very different, the vastly bigger farms and industrial quantities of chemical biocides were not comparable to what happened on British farms, and that there were already systems in place to deal with the safety of agricultural chemicals.  [Mark ref]

In 1964 Horizon aired "Pesticides or Posterity" in which a sensitive countryside landed, plus fours wearing, Rolls Royce driving gentleman romantically talked about the need for wilderness and balances between farming and nature was paired with a director of a modern chemical plant, much modest in his choice of car talked about the need for chemicals to help feed the population and their role in avoidable illnesses across the world, complete with gruesome images of elephantiasis and river blindness. This was a very early, if not the first, public use of the term "chemophobia". The chemical plant director made the charge of fear of chemicals at the 

Even though these uses initially seem like they are purely agricultural, their effects that were felt or percieved more widely, perhaps through greater reporting of rare incidents or greater experience of other countires adn cultures as people became more widely travelled. For those living near farms, notification of farmers using sprays and the complications of spray drift were worries. Even though ariel spraying was rarely appropriate in the UK, and to spray in condition s that would result in the misapplication (wastage) of chemical would not be in the farmer's interest, the idea that helicopters were spraying complicated poisons caused fears. There were stories into the 1980s of people who had been severely sickened, incapacitated by exposure to agricultural chemicals while in their own garden. The issues of residues from agricultural chemicals on foodstuffs was of concern, whether it was detectable simply by taste or that there was a known or unknown physical effect. 

The idea that cancer, devestating and hard to explain,  was increasing in frequency was an important factor in these routes of exposure through the place that you lived, worked, breathed or ate.  Perhaps it was newspaper reporting, government drives to improve cancer diagnosis and treatment, increased detection and naming, facilitating the removal of barriers to talking about cancers meaning that they were in the public mind as something that could happen to you. Trivial, everyday choices became laden with cancerphobia. Animal testing for agricultural and household chemicals was crude, with lethal doses, (LD50s), irritancy, and teratogencity being used as indicators of the chemical's likely effect on humans. [I actually haven't read very much about this- though I suppose I must have read something] The true effects could be quite different but the fact that tumours were something that cropped up as outcomes in these investigations was alarming to any casual reader. The communication of what these results mean (in terms of risk) for normal exposure or everyday life has been something of a battle. It is hard to generalise, as peoples susceptibility to disease and chemicals are so varied.  As seen with studies of chemicals like arsenic, a dose that could kill one person might merely irritate another. This is not to mention the variabiliy in doses that anyone might be exposed to. The length of time spent using a product or chemical in one sitting, how well or poorly ventilated the space might be, whether protective clothing is worn (here I count an apron or housecoat as protective clothing, as it is an extra barrier to splashes and dusts).

Leaky knapsack sprayers were news when they caused agricultural workers to have close prolonged contact with undesirable chemicals, but how often were faulty household packages held up for inspection or for blame? 
(some kind of cleaner bought from harrods is all I can think of here)
