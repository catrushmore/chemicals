1930s
The period under investigation starts at a time of worldwide economic depression. The number of Britains unemployed had reached 2.5 million. It might be expected that household expenditures were examined by housewives, that stains to clothes would be removed to avoid having to buy new ones, that the expenses incurred on keeping a house in order might be economised on by not using a domestic servant, by knowing enough about which chemicals could be used for multiple cleaning and household purpses, or choosing well priced, effective multipurpose products. [EVIDENCE]

1939
War breaks out, but in the lead up to it, there had been much discussion of the possibility of chemical weapons. The distribution of gas masks, gas drills reinforced the fears. Some household chemicals were recommended as treatment for exposure to mustard gas.  [ARRRRGGHHH - where is my spreadsheet/ pictures?]

With certain supply lines cut off, chemical manufacture had to become self sufficient, or stop producing certain products for consumers ,with any production being diverted for war use. Packaging was affected by the desire to conserve metals and paper, so where possible tins became cardboard boxes and the cardboard became flimsier, the colours more drab and utilitarian, though sometimes having extensive copy about why that was.  Recycling and reuse were encouraged patriotically. The necessity of keeping rationed clothes looking good presented a boon to dry cleaning fluid manufacturers keen to provide alterntives to petrol (rationed) and benzene.  The upheaval and dirt of bombing, lodgers or evacuees presented an extra burden of cleaning to their hosts, who wanted to keep respectable, healthy, homely facilities.  Grimy, tedious and awkward tasks like cleaning the oven could be framed by advertisers as contributing to the war effort, in this case, cleaning the oven was a method of reducing fuel consumption, if not saving the energy of the housewife often depicted on hands and knees, but smiling as she worked. 


New garden products came onto the market to help inexperienced gardeners feed their vegetables and fruit correctly, maximising production and minimising wastage of chemicals if they were applied in the wrong proportions. 

As more households had indoor toilets, even multiple toilets, there was increased pressure for cleanliness and most importantly, deodorisation. It would be hard to find even the most dedicated of housekeeper who wanted to spend long on this task, so products that did the job fast or were permanently present so that a cleaning task could be avoided almost entirely, were very appealing. 

The availability of new synthetic materials for the home and garments meant a new set of rules about stain removal and appriate treatment had to be learned by those who wanted to keep their fashionable products looking good. Along with the new wave of domestic labour saving appliances came a demand for chemical products. Had anything similar been seen with electification/ gasification?  

A need to maximise the productive capacity of Britain's farmland meant that in the 1960s when a completely new method of farming was developed to accompany a new weedkiller invented by ICI. Gardening was a popular expression of domesticity DIY and if there were miracle weedkillers to lighten the load of continual vigilance against weeds, gardeners wanted them. Green, verdant lawns and neat orderly gardens could be interpreted as a reaction against burned out, bombed and disorderly landscapes of war. This was an arena where people could be in charge (not the weeds).
