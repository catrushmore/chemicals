In recent decades, studies on experts and environmental history have become blooming areas of research placed at the crossroad of many academic traditions including history of science, technology and medicine. Studies on expertise and experience were once dubbed as the “third wave of science studies” (Collins and Evans, 2003). Numerous workshops and meetings have been organized around the problems of legitimation, authority, credibility and extension of expert knowledge in different social and cultural environments: criminal investigation departments, patent and tort litigation, advisory committees, think tanks, international organizations, industry, etc. A large number of papers, collective publications and monographs have been published on these topics during the last decade from a broad variety of perspectives ranging from Collins and Evans (2007) to Oreskes and Conway (2010). Enviromental history has also experienced an outstanding growth in the last decade, as can be clearly perceived throughout the numerous and successful initiatives promoted from the American and the European Societies for Environmental History.  Many of the studies focus on the interaction among the actors (experts, activists, NGOs, stakeholders, industry, government, etc.) involved in the process of regulating toxic products
 
Different perceptions of toxicants and their risks, cultures of risk assessment and civic epistemologies have been mostly studied in contemporary societies. More recent studies have shown the long roots of “risk society” before the twentieth-century (Fressoz, 2012, Le Roux, 2011). Other authors have reviewed the role of industry in making both knowledge and ignorance about toxicants, sometimes promoting public debates on the uncertainties concerning the causal connections between toxic products and health problems (Markowitz-Rosner, 2002; Proctor- Schiebinger, 2008, Oreskes-Conway, 2010, etc.). The limits of the legal systems (tort litigation) in preventing and managing risks from toxicants has been analysed by historians and philosophers of law (Cranor, 1993, 2011). Many of the studies are focussed on a particular product and its regulation, for instance, lead (Markowitz-Rosner, 2013), tobacco (Proctor, 2011), DDT (Kinkela, 2011), radioisotopes (Creager, 2013), hormone disruptors (Langston, 2010), fumes (Mosley, 2001; Uekoetter, 2009, Le Roux, 2011), etc. These and many other perspectives on environmental history and recent studies on expertise and experience have converged into a fascinating domain, which we would like to explore in the 8th European Spring School in History of Science and Popularization. The thrust of this School emerged during the seminars on “Toxic Atmospheres” which were organized between 2012 and 2014 in Valencia.
 
As in previous years, the School is structured in three key-note lectures and a research workshop. The common topics are the mentioned issues regarding the regulation and risk management of toxics from the perspective of different actors (industry, government, experts, activists, stakeholders, patients, etc.) during the last two centuries (1800-2000).  The keynote lectures will be delivered by three outstanding scholars covering three particular toxics (fumes, pesticides and lead) from the beginning of nineteenth century to the end of the twentieth century.       

Papers are expected to cover issues related to the regulation of toxics, public controversies, activism, public health, toxic torts and so on. They may be focused on a particular substance or group of products: chemicals, drugs, tobacco, cosmetics, pesticides, fumes, air and water pollution, fertilizers, asbestos, food adulterants and additives, genetic modified organisms, nanomaterials, criminal poisons, etc.  Participants are expected to address historiographical problems concerning toxicants, for instance:
 
 
·          Regulation: definitions, approaches and standardization
·          Risk: assessment, management and control.
·          Experts: authority, legitimacy and extension.
·          Money: Industry, agriculture, science and economy
·          Public health: diseases, proofs and regulations.
·          Law: toxic torts, lawyers and litigation
·          Activism: Social groups, litigation and experts
·          Controversies: Academic and public debates
·          Circulation: Toxics in a global world.
·          Academics: activists, litigation and historical research
 
Proposals of approximately 500-600 words summarizing the contents of the paper, historical actors, main focus and general approach, accompanied by a brief CV (one page) of the author(s), are due by October 1, 2014.

British Gardeners and Chemicals, 1957- 1977

My PhD research focuses on several different case studies of users and uses of chemicals in the British home between the 1930s and the 1980s. One of these case studies is gardening.  Consumers, the people who willingly buy and use chemicals, are an important part of the story of living in a toxic world. In this paper, I will look at how regulation of chemical products destined for domestic consumers was communicated to the consumers themselves through books, newspaper and magazine stories, product packaging and adverts.

Beginning in 1957, the Pesticide Safety Precautionary Scheme and the Agricultural Chemicals Approval Scheme impacted domestic users, as well as the named agricultural users, as all new chemical preparations had to first pass the PSPS, then the ACAS before being marketed. A graphic symbol "A" was adopted to signal to consumers that the chemicals they chose for use in their gardens had been through these processes. It appeared on packaging and also in advertisements, as well as in books. "Chemicals for the Gardener" produced in 1963 was a plain-English government publication produced by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries (MAFF) directed to domestic, non-agricultural users, which publicised the safety schemes and the use of the A symbol, along with the names of branded products which bore it. 

This booklet was not well received, due to stunningly low awareness of current affairs regarding the effects of chemicals on wildlife. Joyce Butler, MP for Wood Green London, argued strongly and successfully for the booklet's revision to include information about the safe and appropriate use of garden chemicals. Butler capitalised on her persona of "housewife", despite being a highly professional politician for almost all her adult life, by consistently researching and promoting measures that elevated consumer choice and safety. After this success Butler continued her interest in chemicals and consumers, going on to champion the 1967 Farm and Garden Chemicals Act. This  focussed on clear labelling which consumers had often highlighted as a problem. However, what consumers wanted to see on labels and what politicians and chemical companies thought they *should* see differed somewhat.

 This can be observed in gardeners' "hacks" as they would be called now which focussed mainly on solving the problem of illegibly small writing, as well as the tension between the type and relevance of safety information, such as chemical names and hazards. For instance, the herbicide and occasional bomb making ingredient sodium chlorate had always been described to domestic users as flammable or inflammable, but when it was assigned an EC-wide hazard symbol, it received "oxidising" which is the correct chemical term, but not one that gardeners were the most familiar with.  Another example is that based on the number of people who died after ingesting the agricultural weedkiller paraquat, the chemical was clearly poisonous but there was extremely strong resistance from the chemical company suggestions that they should put this information on the label for their less concentrated domestic product. 

After the embarrassing MAFF publication for gardeners, the British Agrochemicals Association took firmer control of the presentation of chemical products and their regulation to domestic users. They still referred to MAFF, with its associated authority but did not focus on diagnosing pest problems and prescribing chemicals. Instead it produced a directory listing the active chemicals in branded garden products along with reminders of responsible use and disposal. The PSPS and ACAS processes were briefly, described and the suggestion of industry openness was provided through the contact information supplied for those who were motivated to seek further information. 

Despite the emphasis on new, stronger, better, more precise synthetic chemicals, gardeners still used old, tried and tested but not formally evaluated chemicals such as sodium chlorate. These were included in the information booklets and directories, and their use featured regularly in garden advice columns, but they could not carry the "A" symbol. Gardeners, and politicians, did not demand that these older chemicals be examined, even when they had drawbacks such as poisoning, causing fires or being used in bombs, but newly synthesised chemicals appeared to occupy a new realm, calling for a new kind of reassurance. For these chemicals, entering the marketplace when awareness of unknown long term negative effects on bodily and environmental health had been pushed into the public consciousness, a system which promised to take the place of years of experience, when dealing with these strange new products was accepted.

material culture, popular literature, archival sources

In contrast to the PSPS, the Farm and Gardens Chemical Act did not receive the same publicity or public dissemination. Dealing with only a small subsection of product safety, labelling, it correspondingly had a much lower profile and was somewhat eclipsed by activities in the same sphere by regulatory bodies operating in towards a harmonious system across Europe. Garden magazines did not appear to pick up on it, despite often running the material they were fed by the chemical industry, which had been keen to promote the "A" symbol and their new products which had undergone this testing. The act was not cited in newspaper stories about accidental poisonings relating to poor labelling. 

By examining the situations where people willingly bring chemicals into their homes and gardens with the precise aim of killing certain organisms, and the regulatory systems that facilitated the availability of new, increasingly sophisticated and better than previously examined chemicals, Although activists may have a loud voice,Without their willingness to use such products, activists would have nothing to campaign for.

 Another example is that based on the number of people who died after ingesting the weedkiller paraquat, the chemical was clearly poisonous but there was extremely strong resistance from the chemical company suggestions that they should put this information on the label.
