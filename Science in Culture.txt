Science in Culture

One of the areas that I am struggling to articulate is the idea of science in culture. By this I mean the application of science, rather than perceptions of scientific research so much. The everyday understanding of how things work, of the use of particular products for particular purposes (e.g. stain removal, weedkilling, oven cleaning) by having an appreciation of the properties of those products and the tackled item. I am interested in the perception of research by the public, in relation to instances such as product development, for example putting paraquat onto the market while being unsure of how it killed mammals, then not taking it off when it became apparent that it killed humans in a particularly nasty way, and there being a fair bit of public attention towards the efforts to prevent accidents through changing formulation and finding better treatments. 

The best effort that I've encountered about explaining to the general public the process and pathway of getting a chemical product to market was the Pesticides to Posterity programme.  

Are there any archives relating to decisions at the Daily Mail?

What types of programme at the BBC would give me insight to this? Panorama etc? Caversham BBC archives. 

Would articles in the ICI journals give me any further information about the public perception of their work? This includes whether it was dismissed / explained away or addressed directly. 

Oral histories will help to draw out some of these ideas, by being able to ask about these topics.
