Prompt for written submissions

Thinking about any time before 1990, please tell me about a household or garden chemical or product that you used, or you personally remember someone else using.  It could have been to clean the toilet or the oven, remove stains from clothes, kill weeds, care for the lawn. I'd like to hear your memories of what it was like to use, your thoughts on the packaging, why you chose it, and anything else that you'd like to share about it.
