control and power

In my gardening chapter Isay that it is bound up with power and control, but these are not phrases tor even images that are used in advertising. Household manual and gardening magazines speak of combat and battles or wars, but the products themselves are not promoted as powerful, and neither ar the people who use them. Chemical use as responsible, safe but not the user does not become scientific through their use of this product. scientists presented as backroom boys no image of scientists unless reassuring purity (generic boots), or when something goes wrong (weedol)

power over things and control are not used in the household product ads either, although power in terms of strength is invoked.
science and rationality are not invoked
chemicals hidden under function, chemicals scientised and understanding about them changes - may understand theoretically what they are used for and experimental purposes, not to be used in my home
