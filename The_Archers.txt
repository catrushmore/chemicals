p26 1952 every farmer and farm worker in the county seemed to be listening and they were all experts. Sent in suggestions by the bagful and complaints by the score. Some suggestions were useful and used, and most of the complains discounted because in the 50s farming practices differed around the country. All served to underline the campaign for accuracy and attention to detail, led to creation of most comprehensive collection of sound effect available to a single programme. 
p27 publicity seekers - almost every organisation involved in farming and countryside (and many that were not) wanted to bet in on the act. 
links between programme and MinAg were very close, closer than would be welcomed today, A liaison meeting in 1953 editor and writers met 16 heads of division of the minister, general willingness was expressed by all concerned to co-operate and offered full facilities at any of their research stations, labs and experimental farms.

plan that Dan should be one of Britain's framers changing over from a dairy Shorthorn herd to Friesians. Could have serious implications for the British Shorthorn. BBC had to concede that the programme's strength - influence on an enormous audience - was also a weakness. No doubt that what Dan Archer did one day, others were quite likely to follow the next day. Plan shelved. 

p40
BBC television service asked for help in its campaign to increase sales of tv sets. Initial response negative. Dan archer did buy a tv set for Brookfield. Thin end of wedge that would break the dominance of radio and British home. 1957 daily figures had dropped by nearly a million, offset by an increase in just over for the weekend omnibus edition.

dialogue and realism wobble still further when advice is inserted. An example is the sermon in favour of women wearing specs, speaking like an advertising copy writer.

1969 -- many overseers countries dropped the programme

Never said or hinted that veal farms managed in the manner you describe do not exist.

Charles Lefeaux script editor manifesto second half of the 1970s -" intended as entertainment, takes place in an ag setting and should deflect rural events and new developments in farming but it is no longer intended to be an information programme. As Controller, Radio 4, says 'Plugs for any cause whatsoever are out' and we must be very careful not ob become heavy-handed when agricultural and country things are discussed. Audience research reports continue to show that two thirds of our regular listeners are working class, over fifty percent are over fifty and the majority are women.'"

Tony Parkin continued to supply a steady flow of farming stories

and to keep a check on the ag content and balance within th programme. 
1975 - ag accountant wrote to the Times accusing the writers of getting sums wrong in the winding up of the Bellamy Esate. Reaction was immediate - govts Finance Bill was being debated in the HoC and other newspapers seized on the opportunity to popularise the v complex subject of taxation. Anxiety in the BBC. 
letter from character Ralph Bellamy to the Times to explaining choice. 

p144
script conference/discussion - debate William Smethurst said he felt the BBC policy document on the use of trade names was ambiguous and Tessa Diamond said she felt tied by not begin about to write about politics. 
programme head said that the intent on trade names was to prevent advertising but the writers had a just complaint if that meant their scripts were turned into a kind of Esperanto. they were given room for manoeuvre.
Tessa told that reality of village life was that people did not declare their political affiliations or views either because they thought them too important to discuss, or taken for branded that everyone else know wall about them. If storyline made it essential, there was room for manoeuvre. 

p158
1970 - reorganisation of Bellamy Estate - reduced eyes, doubled cattle, replaced spring barley w brussel sprouts and doubling potatoes. Tony made dairy manager and sent on management course. Hay spoilt by heavy rain, but after 5 yrs of excessive rain 1970 was comparatively god. Corn harvest reasonable, mild autumn allowed ploughing to get well ahead. Polly reorganised the shop along self service lines. 
1971 - Tony archer attended a course on 'The spraying of chemicals'   (doesn't tony run an organic farm now?)
1972 - focus at Brookfield on beef rather than dairy
1973 - bull infertile, bull calf died from lead poisoning, ewe aborted after being worried by a dog. Elizabeth rushed to hospital after eating mercury dressed grain. 
1974 (p164) = soaring cats of feedstuffs led him to rely too heavily on silage and milk yields fell. Lowe butter fat content in his mil and two cows were blown through eating clover. 4 heifers developed New Forest disease. Outbreak of SVD = herd slaughtered 
1975 Pat bought 100 free range hens (married to Tony now). 2 pigs died from fighting, others developed anaemia when Neil forgot to give them iron injections. Sheep developed twin lambing disease when he cut back the feed to his in lamb ewes
1976 - Jennifer divorced then married Brian who bought her 12 Jacob sheep, she took up spinning and weaving. 
1978 p172-3  cows infected w brucellosis, ferret dead in a trap. craft shops opened and failed. Joe and Eddie started turkey venture, compensation from brucellosis eradication scheme. p174 - Brian agreed to buy Hollowtree pig unit as the basis of a large scale pig fattening venture. When half the village objected he gave the idea up and left Phil struggling for cash to buy his land. 
1980 - p176 increasing sheep to 300, draining new 30 acres, applying for potato quota, failed to get an FHDS grant  (designed for ineffienct farmers). Lilian refused to discus Tony's nee for a silage clamp. p177 Spray drift from one of Brian's fields badly affected Carol's market crops

p179 (chapter by Anthon Parkin - ag advisor writing in 1980s) 
scripts written months in advance, hard to match the weather conditions = complaints from listeners. 
SVD - swine vesicular disease - cropped up for first time in Dec 1972   - obvious subject for inclusion but none knew how long it would last. Every time the MinAg vets announced it was under control it borks out again. Eventually in Nov  we decided to take th plunge. Ministry vets wanted us to do it - put across lots of points they needed to get over. Ib had dramatic potential. But would a disease discussed in Nov 1973 be around in March when scripts were broadcast. Managed to extract a promise from them that whatever happened they would not announce the eradication of SVD until after the Hollowtree outbreak.

p180 strong educational influence - true in the earlier days than it is now, when benefits come was a bonus rather than a prime objective. Programme born as a result of a suggestion made by a farmer at an agricultural meeting called by the BBC to discuss how it could serve farmers better. 

plenty of advice to put over. When Dan and Phil took it in turns solemnly to go through a ministry leaflet on warble fly control para by para, it was not only justified but perfectly acceptable to the listener who wanted to know about the life cycle of the warble fly or if they did not, were happy that someone else upon whom they were depending for their food did.

p183 amazing how similar Phil's routine is in 1980 to Dan's thirty yrs ago... instead of mowing thistles he is more likely to be supervising the mixing of a cocktail of chemical sprays measured to the nearest millilitre which will make sure that not only the thistles but any other unwanted plant is killed. 

p184
alongside debts in ag since 1951 has been the growth in means of communication to farmers which relieved the programme to some extent of its obligations. MinAg advisory team has been matched/overtaken  by those of the commercial firms and marketing organisations. You can have your farm's data put through a computer by ICI, or your dairy her monitored by BOCM-Silcock. Fison will send a man out to tell you if your winter wheat needs spraying and Bibby's expert will call and advise on nutrition. No sugar beet grower looks these days to the archers for tips on pre emergence sprays. He picks up the telephone and gets the fields man from the local sugar factory to drop in. 
Even if no long the centre of ag education, little happens in farming which is nor mirrored there sooner or later. 

p192
stories of programmes impact are legion
throwaway remark by the Ambridge vet to Doris to the effect that a spot of rock sulphur in her dog's water might help him withstand the heat better had a dramatic effect. 'You couldn't get a ha'porth of rock sulphur anywhere by the end of the week'  according to Godfrey Baseley. No one can ever know the effect but think can safely say it was a positive one.
