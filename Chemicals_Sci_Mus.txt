Chemicals, Chemistry at the Science Musuem


Thought I'd have a look for guides published

Development of the chemical balance 1969
John T Stock

Chemistry 1969
Frank Greenaway

Chemistry v1 and 2 - Laboratories and apparatus
1969

From classical to modern chemistry: the instrumental revolution 2002
Peter MOrris 


Look at Peter's historiography bibliography and other articles - more than I thought

chemicals in Museums Journal, Practice - nothing relevant, very little at all in fact
