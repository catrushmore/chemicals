Dame Dorothy Elizabeth Ackroyd. Known as Betty Ackroyd.

Consumer Council was set up by the Conservative government in 1963 to review and, where appropriate, resolve problems experienced by consumers, Betty Ackroyd was appointed its first director. Affectionate title of public protector no. 1.  The council was large and unwieldy and did not meet often enough to address the many problems she wanted tackled. British industry was slow to respond to its initiatives and she felt that the British public acquiesced too readily in low standards. 

The year 1970 was one of mixed achievement. Ackroyd was made a dame of the British empire but she was unable to prevent first a reduction in the grant for the Consumer Council, and then, in 1971, its abolition by the incoming Conservative government of Edward Heath. When the government later set up the Office of Fair Trading she was disappointed not to be appointed to a post there. She always felt that her straight speaking was not popular with politicians. This, however, was not the end of her contribution to consumer affairs. **Michael Young** sought her advice when he became the first chair of the National Consumer Council, and she was **vice-president of the Consumers' Association from 1970 to 1986** and remained on its executive committee until her death.

When Mary Adams retired in 1958 [aged 60] she began a new career. The Consumers' Association, which had been established in 1957, resulted from her deliberations with Julian Huxley in 1937. She was its **deputy chairman from 1958 to 1970**, and induced a nervous Which? magazine to produce the first comparative tests of contraceptives and a reluctant BBC to produce the first consumer programmes giving brand ratings. Simultaneously, she advised the BBC (and was, contrastingly, a member of the Independent Television Authority, from 1965 to 1970), played far-sighted roles in organizations concerned with British Medical Association planning, mental health, women's groups, telephone users, and eugenics.

Michael Young
http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/articleHL/76682?docPos=9&anchor=match

Dartington Hall (nr Totnes)) boarding school - parents had split, he'd been openly threatened with adoption but had been taken to Asutralia and back by his mother.

Since the late 1940s, when he wrote Small Man: Big World (1949), he had been interested in the position of the ordinary citizen in relation to business corporations and the state. This led to his involvement in the founding of the Consumers' Association, a non-profit-making organization, in 1956. He was the association's chairman from 1956 to 1965, and its president thereafter. In October 1957 Young launched the Consumers' Association's highly successful magazine, Which. His pamphlet The Chipped White Cups of Dover (1960) pointed to the need for politics to represent consumers' interests, broadly and progressively defined (his view of consumerism was not limited to matters of price and brand choice). He was the first chairman of the National Consumers' Council, from its foundation in 1975 until 1977. 

Eirlys Roberts

Roberts joined the civil service in 1947 [after working on various magazines, military and political inheritance and PR for the UN], and worked at the Treasury in the economic information unit, set up by the minister for economic affairs, Sir Stafford Cripps, to inform the public on the economics of everyday life. As well as writing reports and liaising with women's organizations, she wrote articles on consumer matters for The Observer. Through this work she became known to others interested in consumer affairs, and was one of a group round the sociologist Michael Young that founded the Consumers' Association in 1957 and launched Which? magazine in October of that year. Their aim was to protect consumers from exploitation by business by providing them with accurate information about consumer goods, thereby also (they hoped) raising the standards of British goods, and enabling them to compete better in foreign markets. From the start Which? was independent of government and business, and was funded by subscriptions from its members. After the publication of the first issue, 10s. subscriptions poured in, and within weeks there were 10,000 members; by the end of the first year there were 47,000, and at its peak, in 1987, the magazine had more than 1 million subscribers. The idea was that the magazine would buy, test, and compare consumer products, and then publish its conclusions.

When the Consumers' Association advertised for its first director, Roberts's application was turned down because she wanted to edit the magazine but not manage the Consumers' Association as well, but when the original director left after a few months, in 1958, she was appointed editor and head of research, while Young became the director. Described by Young as ‘the most considerable figure thrown up by the British consumer movement’ (Roberts, 5), Roberts was determined that the magazine should be written in language that could be understood by its readers. Clarity and brevity were important to her, she wanted scientific and technical terms to be translated into plain English, with the emphasis on short words and short sentences, and the avoidance of abstract nouns. Thus she preferred ‘shop’ to ‘retail outlet’, ‘prices going up’ to ‘inflation’, and ‘poor’ to ‘lower income group’. She wanted consumers to be able to make rational decisions based on accurate facts.

As the membership increased, Which? became a monthly rather than a quarterly publication in 1959, and new magazines, supplements, and pamphlets were added.  The Law for Consumers (1962), Gardening Which?, and others. Roberts herself wrote Consumers (1966), a history of the consumer movement. In the early days of Which? there was a hope that as consumers became more influential they could transform British society, but the membership remained composed largely of middle-class professionals, who read Which? for purely practical reasons. By the time Roberts resigned as editor in 1973, she had built up a staff of over 300, with the headquarters in London, the subscription department in Hertford, and the research laboratories in Harpenden.

While remaining at the Consumers' Association as deputy director from 1973 to 1977, Roberts turned her attention to Europe, following Britain's entry into the Common Market in 1973. She was the first chief executive of the Bureau of European Consumer Organizations, based in Brussels, from 1973 to 1978, and a member of the economic and social committee of the EEC from 1973 to 1982, chairing its environment and consumer protection section from 1978 to 1982. In 1978 she set up the European Research Institute for Consumer Affairs, and chaired it until 1997, campaigning, among other things, for the use of plain language in European Commission publications.
