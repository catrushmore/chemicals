pregnancy test tech

loss of / handing over of knowledge of self to a scientific test kit
women had (generally) been the first to know anyway and the kit only increases the loss of privacy through people seeing them buying it, seeing the packaging in their possession or in the trash

could the same argument be made successfully for loss of/ handing over of specialised knowledge about chemicals and cleaning? 
would it be a useful argument or not?
