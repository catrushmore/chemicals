WHAT LEARNED FROM MAIB

- change plans if weather looks unsuitable
- always do a full safety briefing
- if as crew, receiving less than satisfactory safety briefing or looking like still going ahead with plans set before weather changed, voice concerns so that MAIB can note that someone was concernd
- make sure someone has been allocated deputy if skipper is incapacitated, so that there is no confusion about who should take charge.
- always buckle harness so that you can be pulled out of the water
- use a short tether so that if you fall over the side you don't drag in the water 
- put any unused sails straight into the cockpit
- the pulpit is a high risk place, minimise people having to be up there in rough water/ the dark
- keep all deck furniture uncluttered
- rest so that not fatigued
- don't navigate area at night as fast as you would during the day, go slowly especially when you aren't familiar with it
- instruct anyone unfamiliar with the boat at all times
- pan pan/mayday or phone for help asap
- alcohol, don't put people in danger
- don't be a dick
