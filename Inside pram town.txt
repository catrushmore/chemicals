Inside pram town 

Design magazine  -
"they fight shy of open plan living... there si s strong tendency to shelter behind net curtains. Large windows are obscured by elaborate drapes and heavy pelemets, by dressing table mirrors and large settees. Corners are cut off by diagonally placed wardrobes and sideboards. By careful arranging and draping, the open plan houses are being closed up again, light rooms are darkened and a feeling of spaciousness is reduced to cosy clutter... in achieving cosiness they are completely at variance with the architects achievement in giving them light and space."

complaints from architects about windows yeavily shrouded in net curtains and from tenant that privacy i s one of the things held in low regard in the town form the planners point of view.
