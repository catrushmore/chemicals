Questions for Peter Young

A lot of photographers use the word ‘magic’ when talking about seeing an image come up during developing. Would you say that chemical magic is special or different to other kinds of technological magic?

In the 1980s books started being published about hazards of photographic chemicals, although many of the more dangerous chemicals had already been substituted. Were chemical hazards something that bothered you? Where do you think the anxiety behind these books came from and do you think they had any effects on British users? 

Was there much difference between supplies badged up as amateur and those for professionals, other than volume or quantity, and did this cause any problems?

Did you think developing chemicals in any form or any particular ones, became hard/er to get, and if so, what did you perceive as being the reasons? It is hard to disentangle supply and demand, so getting a personal perspective from you as a user would be interesting. 

In one of Jo Spence’s books she mentioned that members of the Photography Workshop was trying to find alternatives to commercial products. Do you think this was a minority view? Anxiety that a company could pull a preferred product at any time? How much of a problem was that?
