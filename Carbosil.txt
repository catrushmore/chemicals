Carbosil

Carbosil washing soda was listed amongst the shopping list of cleaning products for a hypothetical middle class consumer "Mrs AB"  assembled in Kelley's Soap and Water. Out of the eight products, half were named brands: Carbosil, Zebra grate polish, Globe polish and Gold  Dust soap powder. Hard soap for washing, scrubbing floors and washing up, starch, blue and bath brick did not have brands specified. According to the business historian Musson's research on Carbosil's manufacturers Joseph Cornfield & Sons Ltd, it was one of their best selling products. Expanded production of caustic soda and silicate of soda and to utilise these in new products such as Carbosil, an improved washing and bleaching powder p158/159. dammit. later described as  a double salt of carbonate and silicate of soda. p198  Sold between the late 1890s and the 1940s, Musson identified the standardisation of products required by military procurement as the reason for its discontinuation. There was nothing to suggest that Carbosil had been of variable standards, but this puts user demands, those of the procurers, at the heart of the decision to cease marketing this household chemical.  Newspaper adverts appeared for Carbosil until 1941, which showed a muscular, masculine box of Carbosil leaping to the aid of the feminised, frothy soap. The slogan was "Saves Soap - Makes it Work Harder", almost an early incarnation of Cowan's "more work for mother", but applied to chemical rather than mechanical technology. 

Nowhere in the advertisements, either those that extolled Carbosil's capacity to "destroy grease" or "save soap", was it mentioned what chemical is behind these abilities. Softening water, preventing soap scum from forming so that clothes wash whiter making them feel and look cleaner. Nothing "harsh or harmful" was in Carbosil promised the advert copy, which can be contrasted to those adverts for soaps which assured users that there was no soda to roughen and redden hands.
