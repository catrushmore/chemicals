lived on bus 14 months, ran free portrait sessions
each evening would develop films in makeshift darkroom and subjects would pick them up the next day

bus is now a museum piece (website) but its life as a dark room is secret history http://www.photobus.co.uk/?id=1

didn't have film to waste, only giving self one chance, one frame, one click of the shutter to produce a portit 
made things easier in the darkroom, fewer films to wash. Water always in short supply, had to carry it upstairs to th darkroom in jerry cans sometimes I used the sinks in public laws to wash the film, or taps at filling stations or failing that rainwater from the bus's guttering, even water I gathered form streams. I wanted the negatives to be archival useful. If they weren't washed properly I knew they would fade or stain.

I developed the photographs in my little darkroom on the top deck at the back of the bus, while my little Honda generator pop-popping away downstairs provided the power. The enlarger was made from a flattened to and reworked biscuit tin with a Taylor Hovson lens screwed into it..
If it went well I could in one evening print all 70 pictures. I printed postcard sized prints - two on a single pice of 8 x 10 inch paper and then I trimmed them with a Stanley knife. I used Veribrom - Kodak's first resin coated paper (then new on the market) because it had a much reduced washing time compared with conventional fibre papers. I rinsed the prints in a bucket. The handful of pics I've held onto from that time are for th most part badly stained.
