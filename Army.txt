Sodium chlorate and castor sugar mixed in with glycerol BP, touched off with a fuse of sodium chlorate in a drinking straw, makes quite an interesting bang... :roll:
Lucky to have retained all my fingers, eyes, etc! One Nescafe-tin 'grenade' went off on impact!
We could tell when the local plod got serious when they deployed their area car (Austin A40) to patrol the brick-yards where we carried out our little 'war-games'; poor old PC Duncan could never keep up with us on his old Hercules 'sit-up-and-beg' bike. :-D

I used to make rockets with Potassium nitrate and icing sugar. I overdid it with one "bolt bomb", it separated the two bolts from the nut and one fragment went through my bedroom window. Could have killed one of us. It was the same bedroom window I used to sit at whilst making explosives. Set the bedroom on fire whilst testing batches once. Father wasn't best pleased!
