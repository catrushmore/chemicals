Is it true

p5 talking about his previous work, Risk and culture "I argue that people choose what to fear to support their way of life"
 
 I can expand this to say that way of life includes hobbies, such as photography and gardening, as well as chores like housework and provisioning.  Products exist so that users can choose their own levels of safety according to what they fear or are concerned about.
