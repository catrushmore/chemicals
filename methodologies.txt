eds Dobson and Ziemann


Newspapers
Stephen Vella
 - reveal events that readers were made aware of
 - document the ways in which reporters and editors throughout about society and the world, how they organised & presented info, how they filtered it, established, enforced or eroded social hierarchies and assumptions, created influential categories of thought

	- newspapers gatekeepers
	- unlike sources with a single author, newspapers have complex layers
	- newspapers frame and report news and analysis in a manner supportive of established power structures

highlight that this my use of the source is from the consumption side, as I just don't have the behind the scenes, production info that I'd like to be able to access.

To understand a newspaper article, comparison with other newspaper article is helpful.  
 - How does the length compare? 
 - Are the sources the same? 
 - Is there a sustained (not casual/ fitful) attention to the issues over time? 
 - detect inter-textuality? (awareness of and response to reports in other newspapers or journals)

Move beyond treating periodicals like fossil hunters, in search of specimens to fill a cabinet, but like theoretical geologists or theologians as expositions of processes by which change occurs and is made legible.
