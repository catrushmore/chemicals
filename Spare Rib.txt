Spare Rib

search for chemical 
mostly seems to be about drugs, contraception and a little bit about pollution. 
pollution is usually linked back to breast milk
though are there any suggestions on how to avoid/limit/protect or is it just whinging?
the only time when unnecessary chemicals are discussed are in relation to thrush Ruth Hamblin's article


I don't know whether cleaning or home chemical work is a taboo topic as it is about working in the home or whether it is simply not a concern. I would have expected to see more promotion of washing soda or something ecological, but I think its all going to be labour saving and convenient.
