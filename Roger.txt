Roger Brook 
phone call Tuesday 11 August 2015 

When did he start gardening in general?
How did he get interested in no-dig, and when?
He uses glyphosate now, when did he start using it and what format did he buy it in?
Any other chemicals? Think he mentions lawn sand/ sulphate of ammonia or the moss killer
	Is this easy to get hold of? Brands packaged, ask chemist?
As a user, what is the difference or appeal between industrial/professional strength product and domestic/ amateur versions?
What about preprepared products e.g. moss killer vs iron sulphate?

Buying chemicals, role of retailer
Are the instructions clear
Experimental uses - off label
