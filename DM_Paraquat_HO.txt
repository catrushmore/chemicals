Daily Mail and PAraquat

the letters in file HO 305/35 seem to show that the Daily Mail really is pushing the Home office for comment, that reporters attend coroners reports and then report things such as Plant Protection contacting the ome office which the home office do not know anything about (they have not been approached), which the home office read about in the paper. I think this is a really interesting way of communicating, I am surprised that PP are not in contact with the HO . 

The do also misinterpret or make up things - eg.

Pickerin queries whether it is possible for having paraquat to be an offence (MAFF wonders) , which I think is what the daily mail reports at some point.
