Childhood accidents


Reducing childhood accidents
Towner, Dowswell, Jarvis

1993


p24
Awash and McCarthy 1987  - common dom accidents inc poisoning happened when parental supervision was reduced, rather than household hazards. Did not urge more vigilance from parents, but tackle underlying deprivation  = better support services. 

p30
safe packaging of drugs and household products
from Jan 1976 in the UK all children aspirin and paracetamol preps required to have child resistant closures or dark tinted packaging. Sibert et al recorded a fall in admissions for accidental apron poisoning. 
1981 Pharm Soc voluntary scheme to cover all meds (fergusson 1992) 

Many products remain unregulated. particularly som corrosive household cleaning agents. Ferguson et al 1992 described admissions over 10yrs in Oxford - 56% poisonings meds, 44 to others, household products e.g. bleach detergentsand paint remover. 

DTI report in 1983 suggested 4 deaths might have been prevented by child resistant closures on unregulated products. 
p31
Walton 1982 noted that childproof packaging without safe storage is not a universal panacea - twice as many poisonings continue to occur in USA associated with regulated rather than unregulated products. 

no evidence of evaluation of labelling of has products by mfcrs

Fergusson - Mr Yuk stickers made products more attractive to children instead of dissuading them.

Parent education - No examples of evaluations focusing solely on poison reduction. Only general home hazard - Derschewitz 1977, 1979 and Covler 1982

Safety and Ethnic minority communities UK

no stats available that allow meaningful examination of ethnic background. Suspect main determinant is social deprivation, which could be linked to language skills and employment

mentioned cooking methods being main cause of apparently high rater of burns, but nothing about cleaning product choice/ gardening, etc 
p34 bad translations, culturally or religiously insensitive
all criticised there not being enough info on home safety issues. Were surprised to hear of RoSPA but expressed interest in it. 


p65 children play a major role in information from safety practitioners [preumably encountered from school/ tV] [transmit/convey] to adult members of their families

DTI
Personal FActors - 

Barry Poyner and Nigel Hughs
HASS home accident surveillance system est. 1976  rolling sample of 22 hospitals
Lass = leisure

Home office and consumer safety unit of DTI  carried out three fatal accident studies on drowning fire and home accident between 1975-77 using coroners files

1977 Tavistock institute of human relations - detailed analysis of 450 coroners files

personal factors - choking and poisoning grouped together so can't really see what's going on


confused (65+) accounts only for falls, not poionsingns or overdose
interestingly alcohold is not involved for any poisonigns/ choking

p29
the contention is that env and product design is the most reliable long term means of accident prevention. If personal and social factors are much more frequently at the root of home accidents than has generally been acknowledged then designers, macros architects engineers etc all have some responsibility to take the implications of these factors seriously and not dismiss them as personal misuse or carelessness. design professions take seriously physically handicapped who are otherwise active. maybe they will soon see the ned to design for the infirm, mentally ill , drunks, drug addicts, neglected children or indeed anyone who is tired or under form of stress. [PMS is included in this interestingly - women have more accidents in the home 0 though this is not mentioned how adjusted for perhaps spending more time at home or being more active at home]

**Domestic Accidents to Children**(1979)
coincide with international Year of the Child (UN). 

**Child poisoning from household products** 1980
detailed study, inc detailed analysis and parental interviews. Incidence, packaging, storage and use of selected household products. 

**Home Accident publicity** 1986
role and effectiveness - road, work dn fire safety , crime prevention and survey of current home safety promotion efforts locally and nationally. Publicity could be highly cost effective to reduce accidents within certain range of conditions. Led to formation of new publicity and policy strategy in the Consumer Saftey unit.

**Instructions for Consumer Products**
HMSO 1988 - imp of instructions highlighted by many studies. Essential part of precept and considered as such by the Consumer Protection Act (1987) Recently published set of guidelines for better instructions and safety info for consumer products - all key features in prep instructions and warnings. 
**Safety word comprehension**1988 
national survey to explore public understanding of words used in safety instructions, warnings and labels. Evidence of low level of comprehension of certain safety related terms. 


poisoning from inhalation/ingestion in 1987- 
steadily decreased frequency with age
most occurring between 0-4 yrs, slightly more boys 949 than girls 853
5-14 yrs 60 boys 65 girls

Gill Combes
You can't watch them twenty-four hours a day
parents' and children's perceptions, understanding and experiences of accidents and accident prevention

used discussion sessions, drawing and writing exercises

p13 children' drawings  DID NOT include chemicals
falling, tripping, bites, doors, fire, traffic, messing about and falling hurting oneself.

p15 causes of accidents - children own behaviour and actions
comments were not watching what you're doing
being careless of silly
running
playing 
being in a hurry
makign a mistake
messing about
trying to do something you should not or are not allowed to do
ignoring what adults tell you
trying to be helpful
being a clumsy child

p16 adults caused accidents to children by 
making a mistake
being careless
not doing the right thing

general ideas about prevention
watch what you're doing
be careful for dangerous objects
get adult help
punishment as a deterrent

p17  specific safety measures e.g. - wearing car seat belt
avoid situation 0 not do certain things, keep in the house

As in the work at Southampton University Williams WEtton and Moon 1989 children gave non-specific startegiesand repeated adult warnings which they appeared not to understand. Although they obviously remembered advice, they are less good at grasping the reasons behind it. 

The people who gave the children specific bits of advice were also mentioned
'My mum says never go under the sink 'cox she puts all the things that can hurt you if you drink them'

p18 children demonstrated an appreciation of the limited understanding of babies. children and clearly learned a lot about safety from how their own younger siblings were cared for at home. 

p21
parents talking about how children learn about safety

5-6 yr olds
major influence on learning, stories relayed of children copying things

school - welcomed particularly active role in road safety. learn basic safety rules - using equipment safely, not running
other children - at school, from siblings, some thought children took more notice of what other children said rather than adults
books

in some groups, parents were not mentioned, or only after discussion of TV, school and other children

but
3-4 yr olds parents stressed the importance of parents teaching children about safety. 
everyday life, "if you see an ambulance, you don't ignore it, you talk with them about it'

welcomed extra teaching on safety form nursery but felt that they had the prime role in teaching own children

some parents felt hat they were not always the best people to teach safety ' the more you warn them not to do something, the more they try to do it. It makes it very difficult to know what to say'

p25
parents past experience with health visitos
one or two parents in each meeting who could recall health visitors talking about safety
'she said about bleach bottle tops and keeping them under the sink'

intrusive, nosy
visits not at the right time - baby doesn't do much

parents identified for themselves that they wanted:
information and advice about equipment, information about safety standards
advice about making home safer
first aid k/skills

--------Children and their accidents
Avery and Jackson

p9
poisoning is more equally distributed through social classes
as many dangerous substances are available in better off household as in poorer ones
(compared to deaths by fire, drowning, pedestrian road accidents)

p13
less intelligent children were more likely to have accidnts than children who were above average ability in initiative, agility and powers of concentration

increased liability to accidents in lower socio-ec groups may e related to the environmental competes than to behaviour  - live in substandard housing, play in more dangerous places. 

p16
ethnic minorities - lead poisoning a well recognised hazard in Asian children - Surma eye makeup imported from indian subcontinent has high lead level. also living in inner city areas, in old houses with paint containing glad. 

p53
relatively few die from poisoning, though 15 000 /yr admitted to hospital. Fatalities greatly reduced - wider use of child resistant containers, blister packs for drugs, child resistant containers for household chemicals and inquirese vigilant from parents ensuring they prevent access. All poisoning is preventable - vital to teach parents and other carer to keep children away form potentially poisonous substances. 
p54
macros must by law put certain toxic household products in child resistant container
mark toxic medicines with warning labels or signs

parents can close child resistant containers tightly after use
keep all household products in a cupboard with child resistant locks on
be careful when visiting other homes - dangerous substances may be more readily available
keep all chemicals in their original containers
keep garden and other chemicals in a locked cupboard

p81
in the 1960s accident figures were very high, a massive campaign took place to reduce accident figures and injury severity which was v successful . By 1970s figs had dropped to below 1000 cases, or one per 100 000 fireworks sold. has levelled out and since early 80s there's been a slow but stead rise. Public complacency and irresponsible behaviour. 
p82 encouraging to see the lower proportion of children and less banger and rocket injuries reported. 

124 (homemade/powder extracted) out of 3886 fireworks accidents 1981/1985
914 bangers
592 rockets
1072 unspecified
others 371

p83 mfcrs traders - packs instead of singles, restricted times of sale, reduced number and explosive power of bangers, removed flyabout and jumping jack fireworks
legislators banned sal to under 16s
banned letting off in the street
banned mfcr without a licence

not mention anything about restricting components being bought/ available

leisure accidents - photography/development not mentioned

p132
role of manufacturers and producers - set high standards and good examples, so influence public behaviour. access to advertising and take the opportunity to educate clients in safety matters e.g. Volvo and Saab use safety as a selling feature. Safety now a saleable entity. 

role of traders and distributors - golden opportunity to pass on info. should be fully conversant with safety aspect, correct use, and misuses. many highstreet stores do not have brochures or any trained staff. 

role of recreational activity supervisors  - responsibility to equip charges with understanding of hazards, to use safety precautions and increase k

(mostly featured road safety interventions, did not mention poison prevention campaigns)
(in section on media, did not mention normal reporting of accidents, only advertising and dedicated programming such as consumer affairs and Play it Safe) 
chemistry sets and hoe processing were not mentioned, nor was sales of chemicals

no products were mentioned by brand, cleaning products didn't get much attention really
