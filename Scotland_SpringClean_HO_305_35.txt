paraquat poisong

note on the supbject for the use of Dr Yarrow and yourself for your Press Conference and for any TV interview which maybe involved. I ahve cleared them with Mr Stewart,  Poisons Board HO, with Dr Swann of ICI and with Dr Long of the firm's public relations branceh and Mr Brown of MAFF pesticides branch. ICI professed their gratitue at being consulted and said it expressed exactly  their thoughts .

"Remember that weekillers and insecticides could not do their job if they were altoghether harmless and that all must be treated with respect. Some which are sold not for home garden use but for large scale use, and that only under proper supervision, can be very dangerous. This is particularly true of concentrates containing paraquat, the effect of sawallwing maybe delayed and the patient beyond remedy by the time symptoms develop. Paraquat is on the poison list and may only be sold by listed sellers; concentrates contianing it are sold under the names grammoxone Preeglane and Dextrom [sic] they are clearly  labelled poison and carry warnings against their misuse. They should now [sic circled never !] be put into other containers (such as soft drink bottles) shotd be kept under loack and key when not in actual use, and whether in use or not, be alsways under the control of a responsible person. There are special preparations for home garden use it is unnecessary and very dangersou to take illicitly these powerful concentrates.
