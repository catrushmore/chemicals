Sensing and Feeling

Selling Smells

How a home smells depends on the variety of activities carried out (or not) inside it, all of which generate, remove, replace or mask odours with more desirable scents. Cleanliness and dirtiness can both be detected by the nose, making the sense of smell an important contribution for determining how well a home is kept in order and from this judgements are made about the homemaker/housewife.

Using advertisements placed in Good Housekeeping Magazine, I examine ideas about how modern 1950s British homes should smell. These adverts attempted to shape behaviours through generating anxiety about smells, prescribing the frequency and location of use of particular products, and modelling the marvellous transformation of personal relationships after following the corporate advice given.  

Adverts positioned branded cleaning, disinfecting and freshening products as able to save women time and effort, yet also to olfactorily demonstrate caring for the happiness and wellbeing of one's family. The advertisements constructed users of their products as working women with busy social lives, who had better things to do than scrub and air the house. For an urban and suburban population living with potentially poor air quality, the products promised to bring, through the harnessing of chemistry, natural countryside and forest freshness right into the home.
