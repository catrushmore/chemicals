This poster looks at some of the weedkillers that gardeners in Britain have used between 1930 and the 1980s. Those products have been regulated by processes and acts designed to protect gardeners from chemicals, but also users from themselves. This is principally due to acute toxicity, with persistent chemicals and their effects being curiously overlooked, although attitudes were certainly shifting at this time and people were becoming concerned with unknown, long term consequences.

Some weedkillers like ammonium sulphate, which is incorporated into lawn sand is practically impossible to misuse and cause harm to anything. In contrast sodium chlorate was always described as non-poisonous and paraquat was advertised as harmless when used according to manufacturers instructions. Users of these chemicals on the whole experienced them as such, with varying degrees of success at weedkilling depending on their individual needs. Some people appear compelled to disregard such words to do with safety, to read between the lines or behave in the opposite way to how it was suggested they ought. Through deliberate behaviours it became apparent that disregarding the precautions for sodium chlorate and paraquat could be fatal.

In addition to toxicity, sodium chlorate has been used in bangers, arson attacks and bombs. Yet it was freely available in Britain until 2009. When the EU recommended its removal from the marketplace it cited unknown, potentially toxic biological effects, rather than an antiterrorism measure. During World War Two restrictions were placed on the sale of "certain substances", including sodium chlorate, with gardeners restricted to buying only 1lb at a time. It was not suggested to manufacturers that they should incorporate a fire depressant, and the best known brand that already did have this precaution in place, Atlacide, was diverted away from domestic consumers to ensure that military and transport users had enough.

paraquat was introduced to the British market in two different forms, a strong agricultural concentrate with a number of different brandnames, and a less concentrated granule version for home gardeners. This was done at the request of the PSPS with the express intention of protecting home users from splashing the corrosive chemical when they diluted it. Despite both versions giving solutions of about the same strength when they were diluted correctly, many domestic users wanted to use the professional version, or small scale farmers did not see a home gardening product as suitable for them. Although ICI explicitly instructed Gramoxone users to never repack or decant the concentrate, some retailers did in response to demands from their customers, workers took it from their employers. Additionally, retailers were supposed to be registered to sell Gramoxone, only to sell it to professionals for their work. However some sellers were disinterested in these rules to protect users, and some people lied in order to be able to buy whole containers of it, despite the expense.  As the number of poisonings by paraquat mounted, it was reclassified to bring it under the Poisons List, then again to strengthen it. Being on the poisons list meant that the buyer would have to be aware of its potentially lethal effects, and nothing more. Those who were truly determined to illicitly buy the chemical provided false addresses in the register, or simply did not care. These people were not likely to be using it as intended, but doing the opposite of the warning "not to be taken". 

Rather than legislation, regulation or formal systems, what had the biggest effect on illicit paraquat use was the media coverage that poisonings received. Journalists and presenters inconsistently discussed Weedol and Gramoxone, favouring paraquat. Gardeners were left puzzled why celebrity gardeners recommended paraquat when it was also associated with terrible deaths. Investigative journalists showed how easy it was to illicitly acquire Gramoxone. Media coverage was blamed for the large number of suicides using this chemical, and murderers even cited news articles as their inspiration for using paraquat as a poison. On the positive side, media can be credited with raising the general awareness of problems associated with inappropriate storage of household chemicals, as well as showing the manufacturer and the poisons board to be working to make safer products.

In comparison, fatal sodium chlorate poisonings did not get coverage and correspondingly its non-poisonous reputation was maintained. Neither was it often mistaken for anything else, suggesting that its packaging, storage and appearance contributed to the comparative safety. Sold in tins of a variety of sizes, as well as 'in brown paper bags' in custom amounts to suit the user, the salt like crystals were not as attractive to people as the dark brown liquid often decanted into drinks bottles which fooled people into trusting the contents to slake their thirst.

When paraquat was under scrutiny by the PSPS, the toxic effects  The potential long term toxic effects were simply not considered in the same way as
