Good morning. I'm in my second year of a collaborative doctoral award PhD entitled Chemicals and their Users in the British home, which looks at the1930s to the 1980s. The content of this talk is part of my case study of a herbicide called paraquat. In this talk, the focus is on two products: Gramoxone and Weedol. I'll discuss how they were used in the domestic environment even though one of them certainly wasn't ever meant to be used at home. 

My main sources have been advertisements, articles and gardening columns in newspapers, because I wanted to see what sort of information was available to people who might use this chemical. I'm going to draw heavily the Daily Mail and The Times, although I have since realised to get a better representation of readership classes, I should also investigate the Daily Express. 

Paraquat was developed from 1953 by researchers at Plant Protection Limited, which was a subsidiary of Imperial Chemical Industries. They are a type of chemical called bipyridyl quaternary salts, and they showed unusually strong herbicidal action when they were screened to find out what they might be good for. They were rapidly inactivated by clay particles in the soil, which was not how most of the weedkillers on the market at the time worked.  William Boon, an ICI biochemist convinced his colleagues that it could be a useful property. Dried up, desiccated weed material would act as a mulch, ploughing could be reduced, moisture retained and pasture improved.  ICI promised that paraquat would boost the nation's total area of productive land, and exports would guarantee riches to the UK's. In post-war Britain rebuilding its economy, these were powerful motivators to develop a new product. 

ICI's "chemical plough" was introduced to the agricultural and horticultural market in 1962, under the brand name Gramoxone W, which had a concentration of active ingredient paraquat at 20%. It only had approval for use in non-domestic situations, and supposed to be available only from certain suppliers. Gramoxone came as a brown liquid and among the warnings about avoiding contact with skin and eyes, or breathing in mists, there were instructions that it should not be repacked from the original containers. This new agrochemical was introduced to readers of business and agriculture sections of the newspaper, emphasising the economic benefits to farmers and industry.

You might expect that Gramoxone, not intended for home use, would not be advertised in everyday newspapers. In fact it was, in the Times. Gramoxone appeared in two types of advert, one was generally educational, profile boosting advert, not designed to sell any specific products to the reader [show 1963 Research springboard]. The other was in an agricultural supplement or special report which The Times biannually. ICI would only pay to place ads where they would pay off, so we can see the Times readership as potentially reaching decision makers. Here we can see ICI's ideal gramoxone user; he's a farmer, willing to try new technologies, bettering his farm for the long term. No adverts introducing Gramoxone in the early 1960s were placed in The Daily Mail, indicating that this audience was not considered by ICI to be rich in agrochemical buyers. 

The strength of Gramoxone was supposed to put it out of reach for any casual user. For domestic users or amateur gardeners Plant Protection developed a less concentrated paraquat-based weedkiller called Weedol, which they started marketing in 1965, with the Daily Mail carrying adverts from 1966 and The Times from 1967. In December 1964, paraquat for amateur use was already being excitedly anticipated in the Mail's and the Times' gardening columns with the focus on reducing time spent weeding and backache. 

The active ingredient, paraquat, was only 5% instead of 20%, although the adverts at this time do not show this.  It was sold as small packets of granules or pellets, where the whole amount packet was to be dissolved directly in a 2 gallon watering can. This reduced the need for the user to measure out or handle the product. The fairly small amount of solution meant that it should all be used up, so that there wouldn't be any left over that people might be tempted to store. In these earliest adverts, [show 1966 advert] we aren't shown a full image of the user but we can see some hands in masculine shirt sleeves, trousered legs. No kneeling, no grass or mud stains here, using Weedol is clean and easy. We're given a lot of information about the product and its benefits, which technology you should apply it with and where to use it. In slightly later adverts [show 1968 advert], we are shown this domesticated, middle aged man, he's got a bit of a paunch, he's relaxed, one hand for weeding, he can smoke a pipe, he's at leisure in his garden. Women as weedkillers are not shown in any of these adverts. Are women less inclined to use weedkillers, preferring to go round once rather than twice, once for applying and again later to pull up and dispose of the desiccated weeds? Are women supposed to be nurturing rather than destructive? Maybe who actually uses weedkillers, and their reasons, will come through in oral history work or more archival research. 

When Plant Protection were going through the Advisory Committee on Poisonous Substances Used in Agriculture and Food Storage's approval process in 1962, they had to show that they had explored not only the beneficial herbicidal outcomes, but also what happened in non-ideal scenarios.  They presented results from acute and chronic LD50 tests on rats, rabbits and a small sample of hens. Death from acute poisoning was possible, but also at low enough concentrations, paraquat could be eliminated without any apparent effects. Disruption of finger nail growth and nosebleeds in staff packing the chemical had also been observed, explained away by improving the use of gloves and better ventilation, despite the mechanism of action being unknown.  The benefits of the chemical seemed to outweigh the potential problems, problems that could be avoided if sensible precautions were taken.  

In discussion with MAFF, ICI hoped that humans might be able to better eliminate the chemical more effectively than their animal models. Approval was granted, under the condition that they collect and report back to the various regulatory boards all known negative effects as a sort of giant field trial, so that the chemical in all marketed forms could be reviewed.  Until 1966, there were no reported fatalities from paraquat anywhere in the world, and it had already been exported to QUANTIFY countries. There had been skin lesions from leaky apparatus leaving agricultural sprayers in contact with gramoxone for prolonged periods, but this had been foreseen and warned against by Plant Protection / ICI. When Weedol users experienced skin problems, user carelessness was the reason cited by Plant Protection.

From January 1966, accidental deaths started to occur, at first in Ireland. ICI decided that the relatively high number of deaths in Ireland when considered in relation to the amount of Gramoxone used was because small scale agricultural users in Ireland had a cultural tendency to buy small amounts in reused, unlabelled containers and that this was not how things were done in England, Scotland and Wales. In addition, the documentation the victim of the first Irish fatal accident in 1966 was described at drunk at the time, all of these descriptions are loaded somehow to emphasise the human aspect, as well as perhaps some stereotypes. These deaths are not reported in English mainstream newspapers.
 
 The first paraquat related death to be reported in the Daily Mail, The Times and other newspapers was actually the story of the first lung transplant attempted in Europe. The focus of the articles was always the surgical milestone, with the weedkiller in some cases not given any more definition. In this instance, it was a reused, unlabelled container at fault, and the source of the herbicide was an allotment group that had clubbed together to buy it. The victim of accidental poisoning was a teenage boy, described in a BMJ article by surgeons as "intelligent", a departure from the descriptions of Irish accidents referring to drunks and mental retards. ICI however, stress the teenage and beer bottle aspect of the incident.  

All these accidental poisonings, where the common link was an unlabelled familiarly shaped bottle, were linked in some way to agricultural use at some scale. Specific instructions were given on each container of gramoxone, not to repack the chemical. Repacking the herbicide meant that it would become separated from the written warnings, becoming a brown liquid in a bottle. A litany of dark or brown liquids: ribena, cola, beer, stout were named as what gramoxone had been mistaken for.

Fatal accidental poisonings as news items meant that paraquat left the confines of niche gardening business and farming columns. They also fed back into the gardening columns, which were often driven by readers' letters, and in 1968 readers of the Times wanted to know why Roy Hay kept recommending a potentially lethal chemical to them. The columnist reiterated the existence of a domestic version which was much safer. But to be fair to the readers, he usually simply said paraquat, and described the domestic version as "smaller packs" rather than less concentrated. For a time, a few extra words were put towards maintaining this distinction in the gardening columns. 

Nevertheless, in articles about accidental poisoning found in the main body of the paper, the chemical paraquat  is held accountable, with accurate trade names used infrequently.Occasionally for greater emphasis or connection with the reader, Weedol was mentioned as containing paraquat. To a casual newspaper reader who perhaps hasn't had their own experience with the products, who were skimming or at least not closely reading stories spread out over time, it would be easy to come away with the gist that all paraquat products were somehow imbued with the intention of wreaking horrendous death on innocent people.

Each of these accidental poisonings could be attributed to the herbicide being taken - stolen even - from a variety of workplaces where unwanted vegetation was to be cleared by council workers, people maintaining runways and railways, so not just agricultural workers, then stored and labelled inappropriately in a domestic environment. 

MAFF described people who brought home Gramoxone as trying to avoid the expense of buying Weedol. From the circumstances reported in newspapers, liquid paraquat preparations tended to be brought home by quite young men, who worked in agricultural or horticultural jobs, or were in social circles with people who had access to the herbicide. One of the accidents occurred in a static caravan park, not generally known for the wealth of their inhabitants.  In Weedol adverts that depicted a user, the imagined, perhaps affluent, user  did not match the image of those who were involved in accidental gramoxone poisoning cases.
 
All these stories invariably conveyed the lack of effective treatment available, often deploying the stock phrase "no known antidote".  The idea of no effective treatment for this new type of poisoning grabbed the imagination, and it was frightening. Arsenic and mercury based weedkillers had been poisoning people fatally for much longer, and correspondingly progression and management of poisoning was better understood and accepted. As Boon wearily noted, this antidote statement was technically accurate, but it was not unusual as in the true sense of antidote, very few poisons have an antidote. However, it was useful shorthand in newspapers for expressing the horror and despair that was experienced by victims, their families, and the medics who cared for them. The lining of the mouth and throat could be burned and ulcerated, and the kidneys could also be acutely stressed and permanently damaged. In the lungs, paraquat causes cell proliferation and inflammation, described in newspapers as solidifying, which steadily and irreversibly reduced lung function. Despite doctors' best efforts to deactivate or dilute the chemical in the bloodstream, they were very rarely successful, it was often hard to know how much had been ingested to start with and tests for quantifying paraquat in blood and urine were crude.  

When reporting accidents, journalists were objective towards those who brought the potent chemical home and accidentally poisoned a  family member. However, they didn't mince words when they could be delivered from authority figures. William Boon, father of paraquat, was reported as attributing accidental deaths to "human stupidity". Keeping Gramoxone in unmarked, reused bottles was "asking for it", The Times reported a coroner as saying in 1969. 

Plant Protection were resistant to suggestions that the word "Poison" should be included on the label, preferring the alternative wording "Not to be taken" and "Harmful if taken" or "Dangerous if swallowed" which are really not as hard hitting. They maintained that when users followed the instructions, the product was safe.

[show article] In 1972, marking ten years of paraquat on the market and six years since the first fatality, the Daily Mail took up the cause of accidental paraquat poisoning.  The newspaper ran their own investigation into how easy it was to obtain Gramoxone, showing that controls on retail were not working. They contacted spokespeople from Plant Protection, ICI, MAFF, as well as the pharmaceutical society, and were able to portray the chemical company as working hard to change formulation, and to find better treatments. They kept a running totals of deaths, continued pressing for better retail practices, clearer labelling, and more thorough governmental approval processes, but the regular mentions of paraquat in the gardening column stopped until 1976, and adverts for Weedol disappeared from its pages until 1978.

However, another consequence of reporting fatalities from the chemical was increased visibility, or occurrence, of deliberate poisonings. In  1973 Dr Matthews of the Poisons Board blamed what he called "disproportionate" media coverage given to paraquat deaths for the fact that in Scotland, the number of accidental deaths from paraquat was overshadowed by the number of suicides with the chemical. Weedol featured in numerous para-suicides; the reports in medical journals of this uses of the domestic chemical do not state whether the user knowingly chose this weaker form as a signal of distress, or because they were unaware that the paraquat reported on in most news stories was actually the more potent form Gramoxone. 

In 1974 the first trial of a murder using paraquat, in the form of Gramoxone, was reported on. The Daily Mail followed that trial doggedly over 12 articles, to the Times 2. Murderous paraquat users were portrayed as adulterous, jealous men and women, in turbulent or unconventional relationships, who administered the weedkiller in sherry, cups of tea or mixed into stews. Paraquat murder trials were described in great detail in the newspaper. In one case, a woman who poisoned her husband even stated that she had got the idea from a story in the newspaper. On this subject, newspapers remained quiet, despite the question of their responsibility for copy-cat behaviour triggering. 

Wrapping Up

Paraquat, as both Gramoxone and Weedol, was enthusiastically received in niche newspaper columns. Gramoxone, never intended by the manufacturers for domestic use *was* invited into some private homes and gardens, sometimes resulting in fatal poisoning. Despite Gramoxone being on the market since 1964, deaths relating to it were only evident from 1966, a year into Weedol being widely marketed to home gardeners.  Overall, the number of deaths in relation to the total volume of paraquat sold and used was very small, the precautions were easily followed and the herbicide very effective. This meant that ICI and regulatory government committees could not seriously contemplate a ban, although ICI were directed to, and did, investigate a variety of changes to the formulation, adding Bitrex to deter people from drinking large amounts, and a chemical to make Gramoxone smell foul. 

Unintended uses of paraquat herbicides brought the chemical to wider attention, and media reports, which for brevity and impact blurred the distinction between Weedol and Gramoxone, contributed to unintended uses being perpetuated. However, newspapers, especially the Daily Mail, attempted to educate readers to improve their own home's safety through proper storage of all household chemicals. 

Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your comments and questions.
