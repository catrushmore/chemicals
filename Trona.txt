most informative - discovered 1938, first mine shaft 1946, commercial soda production 1948 all previous soda production in USA was synthetic/ solvay
dry and wet extraction

No-one seems to have written much about the history of the soda industry in the USA? Big changes in 1940s
though Arm & Hammer/Cow  [Church&Dwight] did not jump on board the Trona train until 1968.

Had wondered whether the availability and low cost of soda had influenced the household uses side, but probably not as the publishers of those leaflets, Church and Dwight, were not necessarily producing it any cheaper at these points in time. 

Wondered if mining it could be counted as green, so fitting in with the environmental awareness issues, and while there is a push from the mining fraternity that it is energetically less intensive than from salt, and apparently produces fewer harmful waste products.

no subsidence, no environmental problems

Would be interested to know whether exports from the States had an impact on the 'cost of production' in the UK, i.e. if it was dumped, or it became less competitive. It's not as if salt extraction has stopped in the northwest because of it. 

(Borax mined elsewhere, California, e.g. the Searles Lake where the borax was visible
p105 entire surface glistened in the sun, because it was composed of a crust of soda and borate of lime.... a little stream ran down the canyon. I tasted the water which was not potable having run a long distance through alkali as was easy to recognise because the banks of the stream were covered with a saline layer.
p110 ...entire surface resembled a plain covered with snow. in some places this white cover glistened in the sun with a bluish reflection.
