linking sections
watch out for short paras - undeveloped concepts. Unpack further.

different levels - make sure subheadings are introduced in words and also laid out with fonts

who is producing the categories - the compay
the users produced by newspapers
by MAFF 

what makes a user? produced in the domestic space but also interactions

public private dichotomy
	definitely look into this
	
be prepared to cover things in shorthand, rather than repeat in full, direct /remind readers that you have covered this

section order - 6-8 
poisoning is too soon, don't go into detail straying into domain of user
also suicide p10, keep like sections together

add column - context, regulation/context?
poisons law,  MAFF formation/key activities, Pesticides Safety Scheme etc, helpful to me and reader to see how they relate

companies have to request to use a brand name - there should be a primary source

history of brands - alcoholic beverages
patent literature - patents themselves, see also

be descriptive wherever possible
package inserts? can I get any of these
think about / find evidence of what would users have seen - oral history?
use pictures too

final chapter/s - where really engage with what it was to be domestic user of chemicals

users are hard to control - what is their relationship to chemicals and regulations
experimental category needs expansion

define domestic user - state which boundaries are permeable (re. farmers not being domestic, but are also householders etc)
be explicit - use the discussion with Viviane 

almost like equation of experience + careless = disobedience
user this to help investigate what you mean by different types of user

who decides entitlement

discussion on nature of sources (newspapers, adverts) - refer to methodological chapter -
