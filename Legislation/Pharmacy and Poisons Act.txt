Hansards: http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=1952-11-27a.927.1 DDT in Milk  27 November 1952Labelling: The hon. Member says they require labelling to indicate to the public the contents. I do not exclude that possibility. I would say that when that requirement was demanded for patent medicines the chemical formula which subsequently appeared on the labels conveyed nothing to the public except a sense of importance which is aroused in some people when they believe they are taking some unusually complicated medicine.  04/02/1954 http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=1954-02-04a.704.3 http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=1964-12-22a.1054.0 Joyce Butler – involved in many consumer and chemical parliamentary debates	Thalidomide, lead in petrol, pesticides, food additiveshttp://www.theyworkforyou.com/search/?pid=22541&pop=1&p=2 Barnett Stross – involved in many debates on chemicals and healt	http://www.theyworkforyou.com/search/?pid=19227&pop=1#n4 .LegislationPharmacy and Poisons Act 1933Agriculture Act 1947Food and Drugs Act 1955 Animals (Cruel Poisons) Act 1962 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/10-11/26/enacted Dangerous Drugs Act 1965Farm and Garden Chemicals Act 1967  http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/50/section/1/enacted Medicines Act 1968 Misuse of Drugs Act  1971	  (controlled drugs, cannabis, opium etc) Farm and Garden Chemicals Act 1971 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1971/729/schedule/made Cosmetic Products Regulations 1978Poisons Act 1982 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1982/217/schedule/made Graham Young, a serial killer who poisoned his stepmother and two work colleagues.Born in Neasden in 1947, he developed a fascination with poisons and their effect on the human body  -  and started testing them out on his family from the age of 14. He escaped suspicion because he frequently poisoned himself, forgetting which food he had laced.Young went to see a psychiatrist who contacted the police. He was sentenced to 15 years in Broadmoor, which he spent in its well-stocked library, continuing his researches and using fellow inmates as guinea pigs.On his release, Young joined a photographic supply store in Bovingdon, Hertfordshire, offering to make the tea. He poisoned about 70 people over the next few months  -  none of them fatally at first  -  while taking meticulous notes on the doses and their effects, and on which of his workmates he was eventually going to kill.After two men, Bob Engle and Fred Biggs, died in agony, an investigation began into the so-called Bovingdon Bug. Young helpfully confided in the police his interest in poisons  -  and had they by chance thought of thallium?His flat was searched: quantities of thallium, antimonium and aconitine were found, together with the incriminating notebook. The Teacup Murderer, as he was called, was sentenced to life and died aged 42, in his prison cell, of a heart attack.Read more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1088801/Broadmoor-hospital-finally-gives-secrets.html#ixzz2C0rRMSfP http://murderrevisited.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/tea-cup-murderer.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Young
