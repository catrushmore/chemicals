investigating crimes  = perceptions of authority, medical knowledge, spaces and places where violence occurs
james sharp - violence author
statistical basis, though imperfect, underreported 
contest that violence is inherently destabilising, and unchanging
violence changes over time and culture
motives and context is all

tailor = swallow pins
eloped with married daughter
joel keyne, ludlow vs keynes

premeditated
could have just killed, but visible suffering was important - leaving him twice by the side of the road
more cruel than lion or bear who will not destroy their own kind (though now we've all seen many films of lions destroying each other)

child murder more shocking than adult (As victims)
children who killed other children dominate - pinnacle of 20C crime
in 19C parricide was top
children innocent, parents blamed for causing own death
often not domestic murder, many in workplace

15, 16 age of childhood contested? 
how can this be a question? is it possible that a child can kill an adult
medical experts said of course it was  possible, if a weapon was involved

size meant a lot to newspapers - emphasised youth and small stature

18 and 16 but described as boys

schema of care, nurture and respect


louise j

occurrence books, inverness archives
incidents which came to police attention, more like a diary
memoirs not very often written by lower ranks, mosty those who went on to be chief constables etc
compare narratives in memoirs and occurrence books
alcohol generally causing the petty nature of incidents
rural 20C has been ignored, in preference of urban, modernity
effects of urbanisation on rural areas - think about this in relation to farming, people knowing each other shopkeepers, community,  availability of chemical

typology 
police administer sheep dipping, registering fire arms  - some roles that just don't appear in urban areas
take on communication distribution roles
Spoke to Louise afterwards - this function was related to the prevention of disease, rather than any dangers posed by the chemicals involved. Any phmacuetical regulation would have been more of an urban concern, not something rural policemen would have been involved in, as the shops weren't really present. [I think this is not true, that there would be some rural merchants who would require checking up on]

alex - premeditated crimes, imaginative, how did meanings get made and disseminated?

aren't jewish crimes dealt with separately within the community?
