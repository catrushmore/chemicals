Introduction 
p5
As part of the Civil Service the Science Museum traditionally had a strict policy of commercial neutrality. Not favouring one company or promoting one company's products to the detriment of other firms. 
Rule not applied to children's toys 0 Hamleys allowed to advertise in catalogue of Chidren's Gallery. 
Nationalised industries - less problematic and continued to hold temp ex.


p4
debate role 
science or technical?
use objects to explain principles of science, or are they icons of science to be revered? 
exhibit contemporary science or is it for history of science?

no debate over main role to present science - in one form or another and by various means - to the nation. Enable visitors to make up their own minds about the significance of science.

festival of science - exhibition of science
visitors had to pay to enter, quatntined from main South Ken site - own sep entrance. Attracted fewer visitors than estimated, but a fifth of the museums annual visitor number.

Peter Morris' chapter

p223 Chemical Progress temp ex in 1947
anniversary of one of the Chemical Society  (actual anniv had happened during the war) 
WW2  - chemistry as much as physics had played a prominent role. 
Powess in industrial research = major factor in punching above its weight in the poswar global economy. 
needed to show that it could be beneficial (not destructive like bomb)

involvement o f ICI

p225
DSIR assisted by Central office of Information and several industrial research assocn
put together display on Chemistry in Everyday life - how chem affects the day to day life of every citizen - agriculture and food, health, homes and building, fuels, oil, transport and engineering. Practical applications of chemistry. 

ran for 11 weeks - 14 July to end of September


So this is before Festival Of Britain, after Britain Can Make It

Robert Bud on collecting for the science museum

p252
bursts of collecting specifically related to or for exhibitions - Experimental Chemistry collection has more than four times as many objects from the 1970s as from the 1960s as new chemistry galleries occasioned acquisition. Even temp ex can lead to this - e.g. borrowed itms are retained

p268 the 1980s
scope of Museums collection:
 - assocn w particular important events, people or institutions historical or current
 - the practice of science or technology
 - the process of change in science or technology
 - an aspect of science or technology in the public eye
 - significant aspects of nonWestern science or technology

potential acquisitions - significant qualities
- potential for enhancement of existing colln by enabling contrast/comparison
- likelihood of being able to acquire a similar object on another occasion
- state of completeness of accompanying documentation - provenance, sigs, dates, origin
- short or medium term potential for exhibition or pub
- aesthetic appeal
- costs of acquisition
- condition
- cost of storage

p269
collections differ in attitude to comprehensive collection
vs
treating objects as valuable windows into other worlds - seek objects to illustrate the conditions process, nature and consequences of application of science and its relation to the practice of science.
