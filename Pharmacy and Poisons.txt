HO 305/32

Letter from Holloway to Bates 25 Oct 1968  IMG_1372 (HO305/32)
Farm and Garden Chem Act - not intended to override Poisons Rules
section 18 (i) (b) and Rule 15 (1) of the Poisons Rules that it will be an offence to sell the chem other than in the closed container as closed by the mfcr or other person from whom the poison was obtained. . Co-operatives such as allotment as sons will only be able to sell p if they become listed sellers -not sure that this will be possible.  Even if they do, they will be obliged to sell it in the container it comes from , not decant it. 

define: schedule II poison and what was paraquat before?
		covered by Rule 15 (1)(a) of the poisons rules 1968 5 July meeting decided
		schedule 7 entry was inappropriate (think this was hoped for by PPL)
		1974 - included in schedule 1, 5A and 5b
		
		gross contamination
		man better elimination
		wash off - agricultural workers handle liquids but not domestic
