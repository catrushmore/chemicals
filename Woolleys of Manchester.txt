Woolleys of Manchester
book

Absolutely nothing in this book of use to me right now. 
Only influence that the customers had was through their loyalty, which inspired the hard work of the company employees to overcome damage and loss of stock after air raids etc. 

Compassion for sufferers, motivated the Woolleys in their business, but nothing is said really about their users, other than they sent letters of admiration and encouragement after the air raids.
