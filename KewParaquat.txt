Mr Hooloway, MAFF
writes about publicity for the control over paraquat. 
The Poison Board's recommendations on paraquat were implemented in the Poisons List No 2 ORder 1968 and the Poisons (No 2) Rules 1968 which came int ooperation on 6/12/68. Mr Holloway was send copies of these SIs but not of the **Trade Notices and circular to local authorities copies of which are within** The citculation given to the Trade Notices appear to cover publicity to the kind of person mentioned in the second para of Mr Holloway's letter and it seems doubtful whether a Press announcement would add to such person's knowledge. 

It seems likely that MAFF have in m[title](Untitled%203.txt)ind particularly the tragendy of the lewis boy who hada lung transplanted, a report by the Procurator Fiscal on which (copy flagged on **PSN/63 43/1/84)** was circulated to the ACPOTC and we might mention in our reply the exemption for trade or business sales in section 20 of the Pharmacy anPoison's Act 1933. Since this excemption will probaly apply to sales by a crofter's trading association  like that involved in the Lewis case. the labelling requirements and the fluted bottle requirement would still apply to such sales. 

I asked Mr Holloway over the telephone a copule of days ago  whether anything particular had happened to prompt him to wrie to us but that he said not. He said that it had simply occured to him that it would be timely to suggest a press announcement to us as the 1969 gardening season is just  starting.   *I haven't seen anything about the volume of these fluted bottles - what kind of amount would be sold in a small bottle?*

Miss Maddock, Scottish Home and Health Depeartment telephoned today to enquire what publicity we gave to the control of paraquat. She is concerned because of the 2 fatal accidents from paraquat which occured in Scotland last autumn.

25.02.70 Mr TL Speirs Scottish Health Education  Unit fwds at Miss Maddock's suggest a copy of the **Guide to the Springclean for Safety Campiagn.**  - guide detached fro retention in Room 301, there is a copy on **DDA/59 58/8/13**

Miss Maddock telephoned on 9/3 + we discussed the paraquat qn, but I did not gather the SHHD had got beyond thinking about publicity + apparently were writing upon a report from the Procurator Fiscal about a fatality. In the circumstances it wd be as well to suggest to MAFF that they consider addressing publicity about the dangers of paraquat to those most to them _ I ahve accordingly written as whtin to M Holloway of the Pesticides Board.

Mr McEwan MAFF fwds 1970 edition of List of Approved Products for Farmers adn Growers, and requests wording fora more appropriate cautionary section on paraquat, empharsising the poisn law control. The effects oft he poisons law control can be stated but it seems doubtful whether they meet the special need for precautionary advice to farmers and growers using paraquat, having a wider object. 

*this is very presumptuous, that farmers and growers only care about killing weeds and that they would not benefit from more caution about its effects.*
