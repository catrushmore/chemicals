Marketing unpicked

Reckitt - relied on company salesmen's advice, as well as soliciting thoughts from grocers (e.g. Windolene)

Relying on distribution networks of chemists or grocers and strictly differentiating between the two, could prove difficult as Reckitts wanted to just deal with one to simplify and make cost effective, but this meant that certain products faced a dead end until an appropriate retail outlet was found by switching to selling through chemists again. However, choosing to deal with one meant that it provided constraints for development which could be useful for finding a product that was well suited to the audience reached through that channel - e.g. Dettol as disinfectant that could be sold through grocers (not chemist) but that still had medical reputation. 

Used in-company testing - this shows concern /awareness for how the product fared in the hands of users

Products were not necessarily developed according to reported consumer preferences - more related to the resources and competencies extant in the company

Products were developed by imitating similar products from other companies
e.g. Windolene was a replication of "Dry Clene" p31, Brasso was the result of analysis of other metal polishes p30
