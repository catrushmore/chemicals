Title	W. A. Robinson slide collection
Date	n.d. [1960s-2000s]
Description	Alan Robinson (1920 - 2004) was born and brought up in Sunderland. After school and an apprenticeship he joined the Merchant Navy and progressed as a marine engineer. He served for a number of years, including war service. He came ashore in 1948 to marry, and moved with his wife to Preston so that he could take up a post with an insurance company as an engineer surveyor. They lived in Fulwood, on Victoria Road from 1949 to 1957 then on Watling Street Road, until their deaths in 2004. His work involved travel around the Preston, South Ribble and Fylde areas to inspect steam boilers and associated plant for insurance purposes and he became very familiar with the area.

In the 1950s he was a member of Preston Camera Club. In those days he took black and white prints, developing and printing them himself at home. In the 1960s he started taking colour slides and amassed a large collection over the years. Many were taken on family holidays, primarily in the UK.

Following his retirement he became active in the Preston Historical Society and also a Mill Engine Society. He started to give illustrated talks based on his slide collection and he took many additional pictures while developing these talks. This collection consists of photographic slides and lecture notes for those talks he developed about places in Lancashire.
