# Chemicals and Their Users in the British Home 1930 - 1989

**Oral History Project**

My research has so far looked at documents, popular media, product packaging and adverts. I would like to talk to the users of household and garden chemicals. 

I am looking for people who would like to talk about their experiences of household and garden chemicals at any point between 1930 to 1989. I'm interested in where the chemicals were obtained, what it was like to use them, whether they became hard to get or were replaced by something else. 

I would also like to know about general attitudes to chemicals, did people read about stories in newspapers or magazines of discoveries, accidents, did they have personal experiences that changed what they thought or how they behaved with chemicals (e.g. allergy, environmental concerns)? Were there any influences such as school, work, TV, film, friends, that people think had an impact on what they used, or did not use?



**Chemicals I am particularly interested in (but not limited to):** 

Carbon tetrachloride - e.g. brand name Thawpit

Bleaching powders and toilet cleansers

Soda - washing and baking soda (uses other than culinary)

Household ammonia 

Sodium chlorate - weedkiller 

Paraquat - weedkiller
