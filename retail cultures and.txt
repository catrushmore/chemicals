has failed to explore an outside - ignore or downplay the people who stand back from the market, feel anger, refuse to participate or at least question its relevance. Not a process of making do but of thinking through and impinging an opposition that distances rather than participates. Actively delimit the areas of their lives that are commodified - ignored by the celebrants of the resistant consumer. 

eagerness to focus on everyday consumptions practices has tended to eclipse the continued importance of exploring the wider social cultural and economic contexts in which consumption takes place.
