control of paraquat

Miss M E DeLorey writing to Mr Stewart Home Office

asked by MAFF to consider whether further publicity can be given in Scotland to the dangers of swallowing parquat. However, as the cases we had recently have not been "accidental" we really do not think that further publicity is desirable and I am wondering whether it is possible to approach retailers to bring to their attention the dangers involved and to impress upon them their responsibility in ensuring that paraquat is not sold to the wrong people

recently a news reporter in Glasgow successfully carried out an experiment in purchasing paraquat by simply going into a shop and asking for it. The most recent case of poisoning in Scotland concerned a young man with a mental history who also had no problem purchasing it from a shop. 

I wd by grateful if you cd let me know what the conditions are in terms of the Poisons Act and Rules with regard to the retail sale of paraquat and if you think there would be any point in pursuing this line of thought. If you agree that this is worth a try can you let me have a list of retailers licensed to sell poisons in Scotland or failing that let me know where such a list could be obtained.

Paraquat is in Part II of the |Poisons List. apart from 5% pellet preparations which are completely exempt from control by an entry in the Group II of Schedule 3 to the poisons rules it can only be sold by 
1)an authorised seller of poisons, from premises registered with the Pham Soc
OR
a listed seller of Part II poisons from premises specified in the local authority's list. 
It must also be labelled with the name of the poison, proportion of poisons to total ingredients, the word poison and the name and address of the seller. 
a listed seller can only sell Paraquat in a closed container as closed by the manufacturer or other person from whom the poison was obtained. 

... Pharmaceutical Society publish a list annually of the list of registered premises of authorised sellers (12 000 in GB). ...
No particular provision in the poisons law relating to the present control of paraquat relevant to your line of thought to which poison sellers could be drawn and in view of that you many feel that there is insufficient basis for writing to them.
