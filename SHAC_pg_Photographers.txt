Photographers are one of my case studies in my project which looks at chemicals and their users in the British home between the 1930s and the 1980s. Photographers have turned out to be an interesting set of users, often seeming much more informed about their pastime than gardeners are about the chemicals they use, or people who use chemicals to clean in the home which make up my other case studies. The progressive replacement of products which were less damaging to health of users and the environment testify that this is an activity which required respect and care regarding the use of chemicals. In this presentation, I explore the way that unintended effects were communicated amongst users themselves and dealt with by manufacturers.
