Contextual chapter
how is this different to a literary review? remember to keep them separate. 

What should I cover?

What general historical milestones do we have - periods of depression, austerity, affluence, types of work available to people? 
	How does this affect products available, or people's time to do tasks (related)?

Are there any milestones here that relate to the chemicals I'm writing case studies of?
	 This could include discoveries of chemicals, tests, incidents that were widely reported (e.g disasters, murders)
	 
Are there key pieces of legislation? 
 	Are they related to other milestones, that might raise awareness / have a knock on effect e.g. wider health and safety issues
 	How do they affect everyday users?
 	
Look at the types of information available to people about chemicals - I think this is the place to deal with the types of television show, books and media.
