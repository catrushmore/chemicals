Recap / re-emphasise

poison - used against men and women alike, by both husbands and wives
poison - against self, even when big selling point is harmlessness
the idea of people as weeds and being got rid of or dealt with by weedkillers is in itself an interesting concept, though it is more likely that this was not the motivation and more simply it was a chemical that was on hand. 
accidental poisonings - sodium chlorate, does not seem to have featured highly, single deaths for children between 1974 and 1980,

explosives - cyclical attention - an issue during war (monitor sales), then only a danger to children = change formula, address sales. Children should be protected against themselves (not the chemical) - difficulty finding job after disabled by own explosive (prob also appears if criminal record) When adults make explosives from it Ireland, control seems even less possible and nothing is heard about changing formulas, although some manufacturers do.

soil - although harm to soil is not mentioned, the fact that nothing grows does suggest to the user that some kind of harm has occurred, that plants only grow when the soil is healed. One of the selling points of paraquat then is against this aspect, that it does not cause harm, although it is used in completely different gardening scenarios.
