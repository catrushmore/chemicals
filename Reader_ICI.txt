Expansion - agricultural market
British farmer never enthusiastic buyer of ammonium sulphate and could get all he wanted before the enlarged Billingham supplies came to hand. Not receptive to suggestions that he should buy more. Depression before Great War, brief prosperity, thrust into depression by refusal of govt to  guarantee minimum prices for cereals or to break free trade principles by charging foreign food with import duties. 

Export was less bleak in mid 20s, although signs of over production of food crops which would blight world trade in the depression of the 30s. 

Propaganda would be needed to convince farmers of the value of ammonium sulphate. It would not be convincing unless it was based on detailed knowledge of the farmers' problem and they might be growing cotton in the Sudan, rice in China, tea in Ceylon, wheat in Australia or anything else that was groable in the markets that ICI thought of as theirs. 

p103
Mond had long engaged in agricultural propaganda in China but had never and a research centre designed to back their propaganda with sci k. 

The work done at such a centre must command respect at Rothampsted Experimental Station and other similar institutions. Not easy to convince world of impartiality of results. Research and propaganda were lumped together and paid for out of the same budget. 

In July 1927 ICI bought 2 rundown farms, 6 miles from Maidenhead and 40 from london, the larger was called Jealott's Hill. Set up ag research station. 

p104
expanded: arable land (160 acres), grass (350 acres), gardens and orchards (20 acres) [1930]
put up lab, electricity, gas, water, drainage, made good farm roads, hedges and ditches. 
research centre opened June 1929. 
agricultural advisors = propagandists
advisory service not just for UK, must expect to go abroad (Empire) 

p105
experimental work = half way between research and propaganda ... to obtain propaganda material or to test under field conditions results obtained by the research staff. 
roughly comparable with development on other ICI activities and research and development together may be said to have accounted for about 30% of the total. 
"there must be the closest relation between sales and propaganda. There must be ultimate direction by the head of the Sales Department and there must also be a complete divorce of the chief advisory officers from direct selling work. (Frederick Keeble)

mingling of research expenditure with selling charges strongly suggested that tin some quarters of ICI at least nothing like  complete divorce would be recognised. Direct invitation to consider research expenditure  as part of the selling costs of the product and to reduce the amount spent on research if selling costs were being reduced. 

JG Nicolson and others exploring depressing reality of ag market in GB, while research and advisory series at Jealott's Hill were being boldly pressed ahead. Taken for granted that ICI would dominate the supply of fertilisers, did not look further. 

p106 apparently unaware that they were at the mercy of smaller local monopolists - corn merchants. Selling direct to farmers was the way to get around this.

p120
cuts in wages and salaries 1931, but restored in April 1933, trivial savings, but psychological effects. Permanent impression of the effects of ec depression. 
Billingham - central problem
half the plant ambitiously provided for fertiliser manufacture was out of action. Depression in world agriculture and over capacity in the world's nitrogen industry lay with this crippling weight over Billingham was a burden for the rest of ICI to carry. 

p129
great hope of the twenties: rely on one outstanding feat of technical development which would provide for a long time to come a limited range of fairly simple products (Billingham : nitrogenous fertilisers, Winnington: soda ash and relations) which would sell cheaply in great bulk, without much call for innovation. 

In early and mid thirties the most promising lines of technical development were beginning to point to organic chemical industry - the hitherto despised and neglected Dyestuffs group, and the outlying cells of it - Explosives and General Chemicals Group. 

p130
products not simple, value in relation to bulk was high, profts arose less from volume of sales over indefinite period than with the vigorous exploitation of patent rights while they lasted, both by direct sales at high prices and the salt to other producers of licences and technical knowledge. Innovation was essential. 

early 30s ICI was seeking new directions like a supertanker manoeuvring in a fog. By the time war broke, fog was clearing. Not until late 40s that final decisions were taken which committed ICI to a specific programme of large scale debt in newer branches of chem industry. 

p134
McGowan was pressing for more salary for himself as head of ICI, at the same time as laying off workers and reducing wages. Was mixing in circles where his income would look moderate - e.g. Lord Melchett, Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, Lord Weir and the du Ponts. 
Britain's largest - almost  only - science based business.

Pollitt - bluff, tactless, masterful elevated from Billingham to the ICI Board on formation. Never entirely happy or effective there but most likely to speak his mind to chair without inhibition. (assume no relation even distantly to Beverley) 

p159
in 1934
George Pollitt virtually creator of Billingham
ceased to be an Executive Director, though remained on the board and took to farming
age 56, full of health and energy. Never confided in anyone. Speculate that all forecasts had gone wrong, plans overthrown. Author of a blunder. Side effect of economic slump was to drive him from the centre of ICI's affairs. 

p175
Govt rebuffed move from ICI to subsidise coal oil manufacture - Govt were being asked to come to the rescue of a lame duck a private venture which could not otherwise survive. Unwilling to see ICI make more than a small profit as a result. Deep resentment from ICI.  
p176
regarded Labour ministers as natural enemies. 

National Govt, strongly Conservative in sentiment. McGowan on good terms with Walter Runciman, President of Board of Trade.

p183
Fine chemicals and dyestuffs= innovation essential to provide continuing flow of worthwhile patents as profits drop dramatically as patents expire. (as compared to heavy chemical industry, relying on single technological devt to produce large quantities for long period of time)

p184
only exec Director of ICI left on record a view of potential importance of British Dyestuffs Corporation is John Rogers. May 1929 - "Dyestuffs industry is undoubtedly the main organic section we have" and "it appears to me absolutely necessary that we should be unfettered as to our technical advance both because of the importance of the Dyestuffs industry and of the possibility of all sorts of lines leading form the attack on the organic side of the business by concentrated research."

BDC's main customers were textile industries (depressed) 
1927, working half capacity. 

IG a constant threat. 

p186
possibly for a dyestuff firm to make a good living concentrating on a small range but ICI had to makers thousands of different products - in shades of colour, and state to suit different materials - in order to be considered serious competitor to IG. 

quantities produced were tiny compared to other branches of ICI. Blackly worked on continually interrupted succession of small batches. 1929: 70 research chemists, nearly half of them less that 5 yrs from university were working at Blackley and Huddersfield. 

research had been intensive since GtWar and results were beginning to show. 

p187
dyestuffs industries were developed for reasons of economic nationalism, rather than demand. Consumption stayed the same, although worlds capacity for making dyestuffs were double. 

The paintings/ images from some of the adverts are in here - showcasing some of ICI's workers as humans/ heroes. Not sure where they will be discussed. 

ICI not unused to working over long distances, e.g. Manchester Hudderfield - British Dyestuffs Corporation, and Grangemouth 
Though Mcr Hudds is lots less than Manchester Maidenhead

p203
before 1939 the process to become self sufficient in Australia and Canada had gone further than in South Africa, but in all local manufacture in co-operation with local interests. Often less profitable and more troublesome than simple export, but in an increasingly protectionist world it was becoming the only way to do business overseas on a scale large enough for a co as big as ICI. 
p204 
if Australians wanted an alkali plant in an unattractive location, ICI would build it rather than see another company do it. 

p251
ICI did not grow fat on the profits of a flourishing trade in poison gas
It was true that ICI's importance to the country's capacity for making war, over a wider field than poison gas, was very great.
industrial base of modern war runs much wider than the mfcr of lethal ironmongery and the products directly associated with it. Runs throughout the economy an strategic importance of ICI arose from dominance of the chemical industry. 
impossible to disentangle warlike from peaceful purposes. Normal actives of supplying materials to other industries made an indispensable contribution to war production

p252
almost any branch of the chemical industry could be converted form peaceful to warlike applications. Others, had no peaceful application at all. 

war required application of many branches of pure science to practical problems involving large scale technology, but it was unusual in late 30s Britain to find pure science and large scale tech together. No other organisation in the country academic or industrial could offer anything like ICI's command of talent and resources of heavy industry. 

as well as working for the govt in their own establishments, ICI lent experts to the Govt. Trained staff and workpeople were sent to run Govt factories. 

p254
agency factory
like many administrative devices of the second world war, it had been invented in the war before, to solve the problem of financing the production of war material on a gigantic scale. 

if private firms were to put up capital for huge specialised war factories that would run a risk of heavy losses after the war when most of the plant would be useful, they would have to make sure they earned enough to pay for the plant while the war was ongoing - by charging high prices. 
p255
This solution did not offer itself in GB in either war - no foreign govts desperate for supplies to be induced to pay for plants put up by private firms. Govt determined to prevent profiteering which caused bitterness in the Great War. Agency factory solved the problem - Govt fount the money and private firms did the work, but without the opportunity of bloodstained profits or the risk of post war loss. Invited to undertake public duty for a sufficient but not exorbitant fee and stop it as soon as it was no longer required. 

Many of ICI's directors had fought in the Great War - no doubt shared the loathing of the troops for profiteers and would have been horrified to se ICI laid open to that kind of suspicion. 
ICI did not wish to be open to the charge of being financially interested in the prolongation of hostilities or in enhancing the price of products under its control. 

p256
the small return accepted on agency work during the war was no mere formal token of patriotic goodwill. The work was on a scale that had it had been paid for at anything approaching commercial rates the income from it would have made an important instead of negligible contribution to ICI's revenue. ICI built and managed 18 agency factories, and before the end of the war it was 25. Included factories for explosives, propellants, ammunition, ammonia and ammonium sulphate, chlorine, light alloys, aviation petrol (largest) poison gas (heaviest investment) and for numerous chemical materials needed in other mfcrs. Total cost of ICI agency factories between 1936 and 39 was almost as great as the cos of the Royal ordnance factories. 

ICI invested £58 m on behalf of the Govt, against £20m on their own account. Direct sales of ICI products too govt rose from 1.2m in 1937 to 13.7m in 1941, and in 1941 it was estimated that indirect sales to govt amounts to £34.8 m. 
p257
This business was done on commercial terms, unlike agency business, but civil servants who negotiated heavy discounts, combined with wartime taxation to prevent any rise in ICI's net income, which was smaller in 1945 (4.7m) than it was in 1939 (5.2m).

Second World was was the greatest source of business that ICI ever had, but it was never an attractive business proposition. It got in the way of things that did. 1935-1945 were the years of the great distraction. 

p262
some constituents of military explosives, like those of war gases had affinities with Dyestuffs, and were peacetime products of the group.

journey from Billingham to London: 6 hours in wartime, 3.5 in peacetime 

p282
If Dyestuffs Group was regarded partly as an interment of economic warfare, so was the agricultural side of ICI's activities based on the fertiliser plant at Billingham. On that side, from Mond's day onward, commercial motives had been intertwined with motives of public service, and Sir Frederick Keeble had foreseen a grand imperial further for the research and advisory service centred on Jealott's Hill, which Mond brought him (Keeble) into ICI to build up. Depression put an end to those ambition, but notion of ICI as farmer's friend, if only farmer could be persuaded to se it that way made a powerful emotional appeal. Then in the later 30s the argument for coming to the rescue of British agriculture was reinforced by the growing menace of war.  **This is really good for my story**

ICI's Ag Advisor before the war was (Sir) William Gavin, joined Ministry of Agriculture as Chief Ag Advisor on the outbreak of war. He and others in ICI inc Slade, were led by the results of ICI research to form strong views on methods which British farmers in the national interest ought to be persuaded to take up. ICI's experts believed in intensive use of nitrogen fertilisers. Their expos in late 30s convinced them that fertilisers on grassland
p283
would prolong grazing in spring and autumn and grass could be preserved by a method of drying which ICI put a  lot of effort into developing. Slade also took up straw as a source of starch to make up balance of foods when using dried grass and started work on straw pulping when threat of war was serious. 
ICI's ag experts pressed ideas onto MinAg through the Agricultural Research Council - body of eminent scientists responsible to Cabinet rather than Ministry. 

By the time war broke out, they were inclined to stress imptc of growing grass for silage, in Srping 1940 they wanted Govt to mount campaign for 1m acres of early bite (spring grazing) and 2m acres of solace. Save importing 400 000 tons of imported balance cake. 
self interest - nitrogenous fertilise and sulphate of ammonia. 
were affronted within their views were coolly received in the MinAg. 
McGowan opened offensive public with a letter to *The Times*
flurry of correspondence with Minister (Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith) followed. (not in letters pages?)
McGowan went to lunch with Minister day after letter and told him that the ministry had not shown enough drive in putting forward ICI's ideas on fertiliser usage, silage, grass drying or straw pulping. 
p284
Ministry had instead been conducting campaign for the ploughing up of grass, and ICI thought it should have been accompanied by drive to increase the yield of arable land created, and improve management of the grassland. 

1940 new govt formed and RS Hudson, more inclined to ICI's thinking, was installed as head of MinAg and held it for the rest of the war. Same time, committee (2 members from ICI) reported on the utilisation of grassland. 
Campaign for million tons of silage, run by County War Ag Exec Committees, with help from ICI. Jealott's Hill as training centre in grassland management. 

1941 Hudson wrote McGovan asking for help on a general campaign for the improvement and fuller use of grass 

p285
ICI's campaign to get views on ag policy - careful planning, textbook example of how to get rings done within the British political system. ICI held a strong position of widely acknowledged authority, **their influence was disliked both within the Min AG and outside**. Sepyer 1944 - prejudice against ICI both in official circles and among farmers - attributed to jealousy  and suspicion aroused by outstanding work of Jealott's Hil. Wrote that Lord Teviot, in a letter to the Director of Rothamsted Expt Station, had hinted that ICI's contribution of £10 000 to Rothamsted's Centenary Fund possibly accounted for the attitude of Rothamsted towards certain problems. (ref 72) 

ICI used many channels of influence, public and private, no unwillingness to play Ministers off one another, even if the ministers are aware of this tactic and refuse to be played.
p286
war broke out when ICI was less than 13 years old. Business already dominated a wide range of British production - finished goods and supplies.  
Every business of any size int e country must have been to a greater or less degree a customer or supplier of ICI, many were both. 
Dyestuffs Group 1939 were making though not yet marketing pharmaceuticals and on the outbreak of war moved at once into the production of drugs formerly imported from Germany, esp the anti malaria's Mepacrine and Pamaquin - equiv to Atebrine and Plasmochin.  Pharmaceuticals group was taking shape and research was in progress in 1939 which before the end of the war produced Gammexane and Methoxone, foreshadowing developments in  insecticides and ag chems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

p300
ICI's official position - that the unions could not claim to represent all ICI worker and it was not ICI's policy to inquire whether employees belonged to a union - was not tolerated. Unions wanted recognition of shop stewards and the establishment of the closed shop. ICI's approach to labour policy was undogmatic and no one on the mgt side showed any disposition to take a rigid stand on principle. Explosives and Fertilisers pressed in summer 1939 for the enforcement of closed shop. For ICI as a whole, it was a difficult policy to enforce universally. In some groups closed shops already existed, for all workers or for some trades, but in others barely half the men belonged to unions at all. There were 35 unions to satisfy, boundless possibilities of strife. 
Conditions of work - factories built for govt were of higher standard of comfort and amenities generally than has normally been current in the country before the war. Newer ICI plants - Winnington polythene, Mepacrine at Grangemouth and intermediates building at Huddersfield, but older ones at Blackley and elsewhere were below. Factories build after the war would have to be designed with greater regard for the comfort and convenience of the workers. No evidence that ICI mindful of reputation as good employers were unwilling to build new and higher standards, but it had been spurred on by war factories and workers becoming more critical. p301

Lloyd Roberts, back from Govt service - Labour Party suspicious of private enterprise, enthusiastic for nationalisation. Suggested encouraging Trades Unions, not in recognition of their coming political influence but of the fact that a strong Union movement wisely led is a stabilising force in industry. 

did not have a great view of unions as they stood - weak, unable to discipline members, reputation for feebleness. Badly led and inefficient. Cannot agree among themselves, fighting for own vested interest without regard of the workers in general. 
Company might expect to reap a substantial political advantage from the influence of a friendly Trade Union movement t within the Socialist Party. 

Closed shop, union dues collected through pay  packet, membership of works councils open only union members. Hoped that in return unions would not attempt to interfere in the day to day responsibility of management. 

These might have been revolutionary ideas, but they'd all been heard before in the thorough discussions of labour policy that had been going on since 1942 in ICI.
