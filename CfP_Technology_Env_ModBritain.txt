This call for papers recognises this fact, while seeking to focus discussion productively by asking for papers that satisfy all three of the following criteria: a) papers that take a primarily historical approach, b) papers that focus on Britain, broadly understood, and c) papers that discuss both technology and environment.

Possible subjects include, but are not restricted to:
-          Technological systems and their environments. Technological systems (in Thomas P. Hughes’s sense), include: networks of light and power, water, sewerage, communication, roads, rail and flight

-          Urban environments, artificial/natural

-          Industrialised organisms in countryside and city

-          Domestication of nature and technology

-          Evolutionary history (in Edmund Russell’s sense) of modern Britain

-          Infrastructures and pathogens, air and pollution, gardens and weeds

-          Bureaucracy (the ‘Government Machine’), nature and conservation

-          Maintenance

-          Agency as a historiographical issue in history of technology and environmental history

-          Comparative national (and transnational) historiographies of technology/environment as steps towards a critical historiography of the technologies and environments of modern Britain
