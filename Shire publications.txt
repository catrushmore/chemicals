Writing for Shire & Old House

We are delighted to consider new title proposals for our established series, although we do NOT accept unsolicited manuscripts.

If you would like to propose a title for publication, please submit a short synopsis of not more than 2,000 words to the following address:

Commissioning Editor
Editorial Department
Shire & Old House
Midland House
West Way
Botley,
Oxford
OX2 0PH
United Kingdom

Alternatively you can email your synopsis to: shireeditorial@shirebooks.co.uk

A synopsis should comprise a brief overview of the nature of your proposal and outline of chapter headings and content; a list of available source material on which the research will be based; and sample copies of illustrations that will accompany the title or article, together with details of where others will be obtained from.

Please note that there is no need to delve into the depths of the subject at this stage, as the synopsis serves only to give us an introduction to the proposed title. Should the synopsis be suitable and of good quality, further details can be requested and discussed. While we cannot guarantee to publish any submitted proposals, we will certainly give each one our full consideration.
