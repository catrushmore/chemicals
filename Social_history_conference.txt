I think that the  issue with the users not standing gout enough for George is because I'm talking about user groups, or types, rather than individual users. This is something I need to take care to lay this out in my thesis and future discussions. 



family life - did families all get employed together, specifically to get the benefits (e.g. education) or did families go to other jobs, what were the alternatives?

investment in education 

forced labour of korean and chinese labour, painful history, reject bid for world heritage site 
nostalgic personal narrative

virtue of infrastructure - concrete high rises, surveillance in the best way, gave rise to communication industry
future of ruins
corporate paternalism
architecture and industrial function
sacrifice justified for modernisation
tourist encounters, mediated, restricted to industrial area, not the accommodation social function areas
different reasons assumed for the group - domestic tourists - industrial visitors, white tourists - Bond fans
national rediscovery, regionalists, 
place central to the development of modern japan
turning rock into a mine into somewhere to live and back
peace museum - activists document forced labour
conscription from Korea to Japan - indiscriminate forced labour - erasure of stories like this
what makes something history - nothing unique about empires enslaving subjects
forgetful isn't right, engaged in a struggle with ghosts of past violence that live on

Jan Gryta
switch from logical progression from view of perpetrators, to social history from point of view of citizens, both Poles and Jews
switch able to happen after Poland opened up after communism and museum curators were able to catch up on current trend
merged stories vs isolated stories
see that they were isolated but also overcame the ghetto wall
fit with worldwide telling of holocaust story - can no longer end with punishment meted to perps, has to end with lasting effects, memories of survivors
missing stories - polish antisemitism before and during war, try to avoid problems by excluding this, though it makes the story problematic
impossible to make statements on how it was to feel suffering authentically
