My research explores the user experiences relating to chemicals employed in domestic chores and leisure activities at home such as gardening or home photo developing. I am investigating the changing availability and visibility of chemicals as well as attitudes towards them in the time period 1930-1980. Branding activities and packaging are included in this research, as are legislative changes. This is an AHRC funded CDA PhD, in conjunction with the Science Museum, London.
