REF, open access, impact

research excellence framework (prev. RAE)
every 6yrs
scores determines govt funding for research
		for academic posts, for whole uni, then uni decides who gets the money
		
	subject specific REF committee, applications are open/nominated by uni or association
	= senior academics respected in their field
	
ECR submit 1,2, or 3 publications, but full time members submit 4 (balanced for sick leave, maternity etc)

strategy - after 2013, before 2020
plan to get book and refereed articles in good journals, chapters in edited volume

workload allocation - not publishing = time for research is cut down, made teaching only etc

originality, significance and rigour
65% assessment on publication in the assessment year. 
publications tied to the author

Impact
25% of the REF assessment, increasingly important 
demonstrating that the work you do goes beyond academia
influencing poicy/politician, 
impact tied to organisation

public engagement - have to show that there is a link to the 2* research 
difficult to measure the impact
have to document this - so keep feedback/evaluation forms from museums, if known viewing/listening figures, visitor numbers
but how to evaluate impact on viewers/listeners?

not everyone can produce/demonstrable impact
fight the STEM crowd
potential/actual impact - be aware

monograph - one subject, one person - specialised, small print run
book - essays, textbook, larger print run, for a more generalised/broader audience

REF hire
create academic posts for just a year - short term, but so their publications are counted. Keep an eye open, a foot in the door. 

poaching
headhunting, moving universities just before REF


future REF
some or all publications req to be OA

what needs to be available OA
- journal article
- conference proceeding - vague
- not monographs (possible in future)

embargo period before OA - 1-2yrs
make it available RADAR/ institutional repository when article accepted.

could end with with articles at different stages, being available
	should be final published version but looks as if HEFCE will not say this is the case
		that copy lodged with the institution - get the info that funded research has generated from here
		so final version with the journal is not counted 
		
Wellcome Trust - requires OA, so funds the charges. 

immediate public - Gold - journals will charge you
embargo - Green - no payment for contributions

govt did make money available for Gold but what seems to have happened is that green is where we're going.

check journal's policy on OA - discrepancy in requirements for being internationally published and the fact that US etc journals are antiOA. 

chapters in readers etc - AcLS
