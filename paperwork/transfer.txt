full progress report
form = summary 800words (HESS committee focus on this)
+ timetable
+ progress report 1000 words (for supervisor and PGT)
+ and maybe a chapter (more for the interview)

reflect on original plans and timetable, methodologies etc

interview, before the stuff goes to the HESS meeting
~45 mins
