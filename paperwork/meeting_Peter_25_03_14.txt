bring out theme of poison
	why wasn't it treated as a poison in the beginning, why was there any room for negotiation when the poisons law existed?

Include what happened before, and what came after (banning in EU - def mention the German ban too). 

justify use of newspapers - this is where people get information from

Peter asked whether you could die from Weedol, I said that it depended on the user. IF it wasn't dangerous, why am I looking at it? 

reiterate some of the statements I make to be stronger. Peter was telling me things that were in the chapter that I had already said. 
	this includes my theory that home poisonings with gramoxone really only become a problem outside of agricultural workers once weedol is available
	and the point about class and The Times - may hire gardeners. Mail , mirror would be the hired gardeners...

parallel to use of diamorpine in hospitals, heroin outside? 

situate work in literature, even if it is just to say that it does not match/support etc

Peter still keen on a very colloquial, everyone knew it happened - re withdrawal of pure chemicals from consumer market, whereas I have yet to actually find evidence of this happening in the 60s.  In fact, this is the opposite, as sodium chlorate continued to be available.
