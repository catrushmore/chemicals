Case Studies 

Should I do a chapter on Weedkillers, rather than one on paraquat and one on sodium chlorate? 

This solves the issue of there being less material on chlorate, and avoids repetition or referring back, but it might also be too big. 

Maybe start with two chapters, then merge if necessary later. Put the contextual stuff about the practice of gardening in the contextual chapter?
	Feels weird to have these all separated out.
