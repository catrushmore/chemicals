referencing scrupulously
	then get to a bit that isn't footnoted its more clear that it is your work
referencing sloppily
	just think you've forgotten the footnote

footnotes - take care
if its important, it should be in the text.
if you make up a reference, make sure its not  one of the external examiners works
footnotes at the end of the sentence, rather than in the middle? Though is debatable. Not for a book, but different for a thesis.

could use glossary if explanations of medical, chemical terms, acronyms etc

Bibliography
often distinctions between primary and secondary sources are blurred - this can make dividing up your bibliography difficult, think about whether you need to
manuscripts
unpublished and published can be more useful, or published before/after a date
use abbreviations for frequently cited sources
can include events, performances, demonstrations - they directly inform the work so are important
		museum galleries, displays, dates - use a photo or a sketch, if no catalogue
		objects?
