Meeting with Viviane and Peter

17 October 2013

Cat's Plan for 2013-2014
**Oral history and ethics approval**
Stop making a mountain out of molehill re. ethics approval for oral history as OH will be a necessary part of accessing and understanding users experiences, even if these recollections are retrospective and subjective.

Finding the particpants and conducting interviews, as well as processing OH will take a long time, so get this done ASAP in order to start getting the OH done and to give self time to make the best use of the content in the thesis.

**Transfer** - in order to transfer I need to have produced two draft chapters which should have been reviewed by my supervisors. For a transfer occuring in February/March, we agreed that I should send the first draft chapter by or in December, with the second in January. 

After the milestone of transfer, I should continue to gather original research and write further chapters. 

**Meetings** 
Meet in mid to late January to discuss the draft chapters and transfer process, to be held in London. 

Then another meeting, in Oxford, after transfer but before Viviane goes to Philadelphia.

**Museum work**

Make use of the Science Museum hot desk system, and also their collections relevant to the work. 

Shame about the Museum of Brands, but I will take a look at other museums (e.g. Museum of London - think they have some shop displays) in case they are more amenable.

**Other archives to consider:**
- The John Innes Centre archive, Peter suggests Sarah Wilmot as a contact there who has worked on env chem previously 
- Rothampstead
- RHS

**Crafting a unique thesis**

Peter and Viviane expressed the need to not focus too deeply on the environmental side of the story, in order to keep an open mind and broad survey of the contexts, as well as to ensure that the thesis stands as something unique, rather than getting lumped in as another environmental history. I have not found an especially strong strand of environmental concern in the research I've done so far, so I don't think it will head in this direction. We discussed how it will be interesting to see if it emerges during the OH work, perhaps people will be more concerned about the effects of household chemicals on personal health, e.g. cancers. 

Peter described a fourfold approach to the case studies. By viewing the choices for the case studies as belonging in categories Home or Garden, then within those categories whether it was a branded chemical/preparation (e.g. Paraquat, Harpic, named lawn feed, Thawpit) or not (e.g caustic soda, washing soda, ammonia sulphate). 

This covers tasks, killing weeds, feeding lawns, cleaning toilets, stain removal and general cleaning, which also divide into gendered roles, tough chemicals and gentler chemicals, but all with an emphasis on care. 

Where a product or chemical is not used for the entire time span under investigation (e.g. paraquat not actually used until 1962 despite the compound being discovered earlier), consideration should be given to what it replaced or what replaced it, and why.
